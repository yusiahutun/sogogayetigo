To hire a proper talent that fits your requirements is a big task. But we have a trustworthy solution for this.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Alliance Recruitment Agency</strong>, is a one-stop solution for all your recruitment needs. <strong>Mr</strong>. <strong>Sunny Chawla</strong>, <strong>Managing Director & Founder</strong> and <strong>Mrs.</strong> <strong>Pallavi Chawla</strong>, <strong>CEO</strong> are making efforts to empower businesses with their quality recruitment services.</h2><p>In an interview with them, let’s know more about Alliance Recruitment Agency and the landscape of the Recruitment solution industry.</p><p><strong>• Tell us about Alliance Recruitment Agency.</strong></p><p>Alliance Recruitment Agency is a multinational company with its headquarters in Ahmedabad, India, and sales offices in the UK, the US, and MENA region. With a track record of over 19,000 successful recruitment solutions for over 12,000 clients worldwide, Alliance Recruitment Agency has earned the reputation of the most reliable and comprehensive sourcing, placement, and back-office support solutions provider for businesses across continents. Alliance Recruitment Agency’s clients range from Fortune 500 companies to startups and SMEs across industry verticals. Alliance Recruitment Agency has expanded its global footprint continually over the years and is in the process of launching an office in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>• What were the initial challenges you faced?</strong></p><p>In an industry where technology changes and sudden socio-economic transformations are constantly influencing the availability of the right talent, it was a challenge initially to find people with the abilities to satisfy an international client base. Also, dynamics in the socio-political landscape were a continual source of concern for both companies and job seekers, especially in the wake of the 2009 recession, when we launched our agency. These were the key areas where constant strategizing and attention was called for in the initial phase of Alliance Recruitment Agency’s journey.</p><p><strong>• Which was that point that triggered the growth of Alliance Recruitment Agency?</strong></p><p>When our international clients kept coming back to us for almost all their sourcing and hiring needs, we knew we were winning their trust. And we made that our success mantra, expanding and enhancing our recruitment solutions, catering to the increasing customer demands.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>• What is the reason behind your company’s long-standing success?</strong></p><p>Our mantra is that success is the satisfied smile of our customers and the philosophy that we want to build long-term associations based on mutual trust, transparency, and competence.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>• What are the services the company focuses on? How are your services different from those in the market?</strong></p><p>We focus on total end-to-end recruitment solutions and offer a wide range of HR solutions from CV sourcing to staffing, headhunting to executive recruitment, contract hiring to HR advisory. We also offer career counseling, resume formatting, and RPO services. Our solutions are quite diverse and expansive and managed through online and offline processes by our people across offices.</p><p><strong>• How do you decide to take Alliance Recruitment Agency a step further in terms of your services?</strong></p><p>Alliance Recruitment Agency is planning to connect with more global companies by increasing our portfolio of services. For example, we are getting a lot of demand for virtual assistant services, and we are expanding our capacities in this area, by offering virtual support staff for various functions from accounting, administration, and HR to SEO and Travel.</p><p>We are getting a lot of demand for virtual assistant services & short-term project-based hiring. We also provide short-term hiring as per company/startup need.</p><p><strong>• What are the different processes you follow for better results?</strong></p><p>From the first step, which is a candidate search and consulting, to the appointment of the right candidates, the solutions we provide are end-to-end. We have teams of specialists from different market segments to manage screening, assessments, interviews, and other talent acquisition needs of our clients.</p><p><strong>• With technology taking over, how are you coping with this changing landscape?</strong></p><p>Technology changes are more a boon to us than something to be wary of. We are always investing in new technology solutions that can speed up our processes, increasing the ease and quality of our services for both recruiters and job seekers.</p><p><strong>• Has technology proved to be a catalyst in the company processes? How?</strong></p><p>Yes, advances in technology solutions have made things lean and smarter for us. For example, automated tools have made sourcing processes 10x efficient, and online assessment tools tremendously ease up hiring procedures.</p><p><strong>• What do you think are the responsibilities of an entrepreneur?</strong></p><p>An entrepreneur I feel is a facilitator, both for his or her people and clients. Ensuring on one hand that employees have access to the best tools and techniques to get great results, and on the other, understanding ways of improving value for clients, are I believe the core responsibilities. Also, intelligent strategizing to greatly enhance growth for making the company stronger in serving customers across markets and industry verticals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>• How do you look after your employees? What makes your team unique?</strong></p><p>We invest a lot in our people and have in-house as well as various remote teams of professionals. A customer-first attitude is ingrained in our teams’ working styles, which has won over our clients.</p><p><strong>• Can you tell us what your favorite book is? And your favorite part of the book (if any)?</strong></p><p>A Trillion Dollar Coach: The Leadership Playbook of Silicon Valley’s Bill Campbell is a book I liked a lot.&nbsp; Bill Campbell is quite a legend and it is interesting to know about the amazing relationships he shared with the pioneers of the technology industry, his journey, the fascinating insights gained from the various interviews in the book. It is also a fun read at the same time.</p><p><strong>• One person, who you admire the most?</strong></p><p>I admire Richard Branson the most. He always has been a true source of motivation for us.</p><p><strong>• Whose business story do you find the most inspiring?</strong></p><p>I find Richard Branson’s business story a constant source of inspiration.</p><p><strong>• Constant vigilance- a need or a strategy? Please share your views.</strong></p><p>It is both, it is a need and it can be weaved into business success strategies so that we are never wary of market dynamics but can find opportunities from it.</p><p><strong>• It’s a rat race out there. How do you cope with that?</strong> I believe it is finding the meaning behind why and how we do things so that we are not looking at the superficial routine but looking deeper into how we can add value, and more meaning, to the things we do.</p><p><strong>Alliance Recruitment Agency-&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>https://www.alliancerecruitmentagency.com/</a></p><p>For recent and latest updates regarding business news, industry trends, etc. Please subscribe Newsletter from “<a href=#>The Enterprise World</a>” at “Subscribe</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZK6tuMiapZydXaeypL7UoqumnZ6peqKzxKeasmWVrbCmuMuepZyd</p></div><div id=links><a href=./gucci-bungalow-8-party-amy-sacco-interview.html>&#171;&nbsp;Amy Sacco Talks Bungalow 8</a>
