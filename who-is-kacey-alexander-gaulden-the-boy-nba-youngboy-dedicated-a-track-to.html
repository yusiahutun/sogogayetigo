Kacey is the son of famous rapper NBA YoungBoy and was born in February 2019, making the rapper a father for the sixth time.</p><p>Kacey’s father got famous after he started uploading his rap songs to his channel on YouTube. He was in jail when the “Win or Lose” music video went viral.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>YoungBoy welcomed Kacey with his former lover Jania Bania. He has several other baby mamas and 11 kids. Here is all you need to know about Kacey, his sixth child.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Kacey_Alexander_Gauldens_Mother></span>Who Is Kacey Alexander Gaulden’s Mother?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>NBA YoungBoy <a href=#>welcomed</a> Kacey with Jania Bania.

She also enjoys sharing content that promotes the fashion brand, Fashion Nova.&nbsp;</p><p>Bania dated Kentrell Gaulden, AKA rapper NBA YoungBoy, but their relationship ended in mid-2018. She gave birth to their son in 2019. Later that year, she started dating Dejounte Murray. She has also been romantically linked to boxer Devin Haney.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2023, she revealed she was expecting her first child with Dejounte Murray.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kacey_Alexander_Gauldens_Net_Worth></span>Kacey Alexander Gaulden’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kacey Alexander Gaulden is yet to come of legal age, so he still lives with his parents. He is too young to have amassed any measure of personal wealth. However, his famous father is believed to be worth over $6 million. With his money, Kacey lives a privileged life and is well cared for.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kacey_Alexander_Gaulden_Brothers></span>Kacey Alexander Gaulden Brothers&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the time of this writing, Kacey is believed to have five brothers.

Among them, six are boys. YoungBoy’s youngest was born in 2013, but there is very little detail on the child except that the rapper had him with his ninth baby mama, Drew Valentina.&nbsp;</p><p>News of his child with Valentina came several months after YoungBoy wed his longtime girlfriend, Jazlyn Mychelle, in January 2023. The couple welcomed their second child together in 2022. Valentina has chosen to keep the gender and name of their child a secret, so it is unclear if Kacey got another brother or sister.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kacey_Alexander_Gauldens_Birthday></span>Kacey Alexander Gaulden’s Birthday&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kacey Alexander Gaulden celebrates his birthday on February 3 every year.

However, he is among the most controversial rappers on the music scene.&nbsp;</p><p>He has had several run-ins with the law and has been to juvie and jail even though he is just 23. Despite his rough past, YoungBoy is known to be a doting father to his kids.&nbsp;Since he became a father, he has expressed his love for the young ones countless times and in different ways.&nbsp;</p><p>In Kacey Alexander Gaulden’s case, he <a href=#>wrote</a> a rap song dedicated as a tribute to him. The song, titled “Kacey Talk,” was released as a single initially but was re-released as part of the EP “Tracks from Top,” referring to the rapper’s upcoming album “Top.”&nbsp;The song was accompanied by a music video starring YoungBoy and two of his kids, including Kacey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nbaaa.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kacey_Alexander_Gaulden_Age></span>Kacey Alexander Gaulden Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>NBA YoungBoy’s Kacey clocked four in February 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kacey_Alexander_Gauldens_Siblings></span>Kacey Alexander Gaulden’s Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In total, Kacey Alexander Gaulden has ten other siblings whom his father shares with different women. The rapper’s eleventh child was welcomed this year, but little is known about the baby as the mother keeps it all hush-hush.&nbsp;</p><p>It is unknown if <a href=#>NBA YoungBoy</a> plans to start family planning soon, but his fans expect him to make fewer babies now that he is officially off the streets. He is currently married to his ninth baby mama, Jazlyn Mychelle.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZqORmLK6ecClnLGZnpmys3nGmqylnJWjerW0xGaZqLFdo6%2BiediorKefkqTGbrDEnaCcmaSasW6tjK2pmpubYsGwew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./best-steering-wheel-locks.html>&#171;&nbsp;8 Best Steering Wheel Locks 2022 | The Sun UK</a>
