You might have heard about it already from friends or colleagues, but what exactly is the Geek Squad email scam?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So how does this scam actually work? How can you avoid falling victim to it? And what should you do if you do fall victim?</p><h2 id=what-is-the-geek-squad-email-scam>What Is the Geek Squad Email Scam?</h2><p>The Geek Squad scam is an email scam where cybercriminals send a fake email pretending it is an official transaction confirmation from Geek Squad, a subsidiary of Best Buy, a well-known multinational consumer electronics company. The email contains information regarding a subscription renewal or an order that recipients are unaware of.</p><p>Scammers use fake invoice numbers, renewal dates, and other order details to make the email appear genuine. They use official logos and promotional banners to make the email look legit, ensuring their target believes them. Furthermore, scammers include their numbers and tell recipients to contact them if they need assistance with their order.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The targets panic when told about a large transaction and call the scammers quickly to find out more about the transaction or cancel it in time. After that, the scam can take several forms, but the cybercriminals' end goal is to extract as much money as possible from their victims.</p><h2 id=how-does-the-geek-squad-email-scam-work>How Does the Geek Squad Email Scam Work?</h2><p>As soon as the recipient calls the listed number, scammers claim that a transaction has taken place from their account. To fool their victims, scammers explain that they can cancel the transaction. As a natural reaction to that suggestion, the recipients agree.</p><p>To begin with, they ask recipients for their personal details—but officials should never ask for private data like credit card details, social security numbers, etc. on the phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Old-school scammers sometimes explain to their targets that they cannot cancel subscriptions from their end and must access the recipient's computer to do so. The cybercriminal may claim that a strange PC problem led to this transaction. They suggest giving them remote access to your computer to fix the issue because they fear it may happen again.</p><p>Once their targets grant them access, they are at the scammers' mercy with how far they will go to scam them. They may make huge bank transactions, install malicious software to scam recipients again, ask for payment for remote support they have provided, or charge "cancellation fees".</p><h2 id=how-to-spot-the-geek-squad-email-scam>How to Spot the Geek Squad Email Scam</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Follow these tips and checks to distinguish a scam email from an original, real one:</p><ul><li>Check the email content for <strong>spelling or grammar errors</strong>.</li><li>Inspect the scammer's email address and see if it contains the <strong>misspelled company name</strong> or if it looks pretty generic and so not official.</li><li>Check if the scammer addressed you by name. It's a scam if no name is mentioned anywhere, or you are only addressed as "Dear Sir/Madam."</li><li><strong>Never click on links in emails</strong>. If you're not sure, <a href=#>use a link-checking website</a> to make sure they don't redirect you to a random, unofficial address.</li><li>Is the transaction in the same currency as your bank account? The email is likely from a scammer if it's different.</li><li>Subscribers usually have a seven-day period to cancel their subscriptions. Be wary of emails that tell you to contact them within one to two days—the scammer is trying to <strong>cause you to panic and make a mistake</strong>.</li><li>Is the email you received from Geek Squad sent to the same email address you signed up with?</li><li>Check if this is a scam by confirming that no transaction has been made from your bank account.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-avoid-the-geek-squad-email-scam>How to Avoid the Geek Squad Email Scam</h2><p>If you have received an email supposedly from Geek Squad and have concerns that it might be a scam, you have done half the job of avoiding it.</p><p>Whatever you do, <strong>don't send personal details</strong> via email or any other medium, and certainly don't reply to the same email or call the number given.</p><p>You need to follow basic techniques to avoid falling for scams, notably: don't click on links, and don't download attachments. Raise awareness of the scam—but don't forward the email on, in case someone else actually falls for it. In fact, your best bet is to <strong>delete the email altogether</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you share the computer with someone else, <a href=#>block the sender</a> to prevent them from mistakenly falling victim to the scam.</p><p>To sum it up, then, ignoring the Geek Squad scam email and blocking the sender is the best way to avoid it.</p><h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-become-victim-of-the-geek-squad-email-scam>What to Do if You Become Victim of the Geek Squad Email Scam</h2><p>In case you become a victim of the Geek Squad email scam, here is what you should do:</p><ul><li>Don't act on anything they tell you to do if you have only spoken with the scammers.</li><li>To avoid scammers contacting you again, block the number you just called.</li><li>Call your bank and freeze your funds if you've shared your personal data, such as credit card information.</li><li><a href=#>Check your computer for viruses</a> if you've downloaded software or any files from the email.</li><li>You shouldn't use the same login details on numerous accounts, but many people do anyway. Change your login details immediately if you have signed up using a link scammers sent you using your email address.</li><li>To prevent scammers from recording you, temporarily <a href=#>disable your webcam</a> if it's enabled.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-to-stop-phishing-emails-in-the-future>How to Stop Phishing Emails in the Future</h2><p>Phishing emails are a nuisance at best; at worst, you might fall for a scam.
