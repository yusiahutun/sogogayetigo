The couple had married in a Jamaican ceremony after dating for seven years prior. It <a href=# rel=nofollow>reportedly</a> was a huge four-day celebration. Back in 2011, the former <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actress had made her debut in legal drama Suits. The TV show helped cement her mark on the small screen.</p><p>The job also took her hundreds of miles away from LA to Toronto in Canada. The pair reportedly had a long-distance marriage during this time, <a href=# rel=nofollow>writes</a> The Mirror. But by 2013, the pair had broken up. They were then granted a no-fault divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences.</p><p>Andrew Morton, author of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, has claimed Markle made a bold move when her first marriage did come to an end, sadly.</p><p>Morton, who also famously wrote a biography on Princess Diana, claimed the relationship finished “abruptly”.</p><p>He wrote in his book: “A wealthy entrepreneur friend claimed that the marriage ended so abruptly that Meghan sent Trevor her diamond wedding and engagement rings back to him by registered mail. Another confirmed that the decision to end the marriage was made by Meghan and that it had come ‘totally out of the blue’.”</p><p>Trevor, with his most notable film being Robert Pattinson’s Remember Me, went on to marry multi-million dollar heiress Tracey Kurland. The couple share two daughters together.</p><p>Meanwhile, Meghan found love with a prince hailing from Buckingham Palace.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-took-her-power-back-after-first-marriage-ended>Meghan Markle took her ‘power back’ after first marriage ended</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-604444360-683x1024.jpg><p>After the break-up, her former co-star Abby Wathen noticed a change with the Duchess of Sussex. She said the pair bonded over going through divorces at similar times.</p><p>“I was destroyed, but [Meghan] was empowered. She took her power back. It wasn’t the right relationship for her, so she moved on,” she said.</p><p>However, an unnamed source told The Sun that Trevor took the break-up “pretty hard”. They claimed “he went through a rough time during the break-up and that was only made worse when Meghan got together with Harry last year.”</p><p>They further <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> the outlet: “He had to re-live it all again — this time in public. It wasn’t the most amicable of divorces and there were hurt feelings on both sides. Now he has bounced back and things are looking great for him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=amp-readmore-target>Prince Harry was worried about Meghan’s safety</h2><p>When the news broke of Harry and Meghan dating in 2017, the world went into chaos. Social media and press wanted to know more about the prince and LA <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><p>However, the comments being made about his new girlfriend deeply “worried” Harry, brother of <a href=#>Prince William</a>. So much so, that he released an official statement to defend her.</p><p>The statement read: “The past week has seen a line crossed.</p><p>“[The Prince’s] girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public – the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.</p><p>“Some of it has been hidden from the public – the nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers; her mother having to struggle past photographers in order to get to her front door; the attempts of reporters and photographers to gain illegal entry to her home and the calls to police that followed; the substantial bribes offered by papers to her ex-boyfriend; the bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life.”</p><p>It continued: “Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her,”</p><p>“It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-royals-hit-by-cruel-divorce-rumors>Royals hit by cruel divorce rumors</h2><p>In recent weeks, <a href=#>Meghan and Harry have been hit by divorce rumors</a>. They started after the 42-year-old was seen out without her engagement ring. After seeing a photo of the star without her diamond rock, and instead a gold band, fans feared the worst.</p><p>But after the mayhem ensued, a source told Page Six that the stunning ring was only “being fixed”.</p><p>Harry had used a diamond from his mother <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>‘s collection to craft the stunning ring. He had actually designed it himself, also sourcing a three-carat, cushion-cut diamond from Botswana. The place has a special place in their heart after they went out there for their third date. Two smaller stones, from Diana’s collection, finished it off.</p><p>The pair will further quash rumors of <a href=#>trouble in paradise with three crucial days</a> coming up next week. Meghan will join Harry in Düsseldorf for the opening of the Invictus Games, proving fans’ panic can subside.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2WEcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kppmUmnqiecGoo51lnaTDpnnAn6ueql2btrO%2F02akmqqinq6osYyepZ2dlGKuo77UqaulsV2WwrW0zqtkrJmpqHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./moment-fearless-ontario-security-guard-tackles-hammer-wielding-smash-grab-teen-robber-jewelry-store-two-thieves-escape-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Moment fearless Ontario security guard tackles hammer-wielding smash and grab teen robber at jewelry</a>
