That’s why <strong>making the most of your results</strong> once you’re out of the salon (or done with your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite at-home hair dye</a>) can be worth the extra effort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One way to do just that is with purple shampoo. Ideal for those coloring their hair <strong>blonde or with sun-kissed highlights</strong>, purple shampoo is designed to <strong>offset brassiness and fading</strong> that can happen over time. To find the best purple shampoos, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>26 editors tested 26 purple shampoos</a>, integrating them into their regular hair-care routines for <strong>six weeks</strong>. We spent a collective 312 hours testing the products, looking at how easy they were to apply, their cleansing ability, and how well they performed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-dphue-cool-blonde-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>dpHUE Cool Blonde Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="dpHUE Cool Blonde Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZgeH43PvV93yMKog-rG-dy2UH9A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dphue-cool-blonde-shampoo-864e67fe17af4f04bcb2b4584a5b58a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It not only brightened our blonde highlights, but left our hair soft and strong.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It only comes in one size option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Having highlighted our hair for the past 10 years and counting, we were on the hunt for a purple shampoo that could leave our hair looking <strong>healthier and brighter</strong>. We're pretty sure we found it in this formula, which lathered really beautifully and is easy to work in. It felt super-clean after the first use, but didn't seem to strip our hair of moisture or irritate our scalp. Plus, it <strong>washed off easily</strong> and didn't leave any residue on our tub.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This purple shampoo actually worked perfectly with our hair type, texture, and color — not only did it successfully neutralize the brassy tones in our hair, but our <strong>hair looked soft and shiny</strong>, as if we'd just left the salon. (That might be the work of the silk protein and hibiscus extract, which help nourish hair.) All told, it was by far the best purple shampoo we'd tried for the price. We were also big fans of the clean, fresh scent, which was a nice touch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Recommended Use: </strong>Once a week<strong>｜Scent: </strong>Fresh and clean<strong>｜Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes<strong>｜Size: </strong>8.5 fl. oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-every-day-davines-alchemic-silver-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Every Day</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Davines Alchemic Silver Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Davines Alchemic Silver Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0RuVVD49zZkSrSFzfXZvDFn_qFw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/davines-alchemic-silver-shampoo-712d5675cc894794809f55b55adeb206.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It didn’t dry out our hair, and it successfully seemed to counteract any brassiness.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It didn’t make our blonde highlights quite as icy as we normally like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We this tried this purple shampoo it on our hair to see how it would work to <strong>remove yellow tones</strong> from sun exposure. We used it three to four times a week, in keeping with our usual wash schedule, and liked that the formula <strong>lathers really well</strong> into the scalp. We always shampooed a second time, since we found that we could more easily lather and spread it throughout our hair. Each time, we left it on for between three and four minutes — not because the directions say it, but because that's what we've done in the past with purple shampoos. The formula wasn't drying, but it also wasn't especially hydrating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even so, it prevented our hair from getting brassy or yellow, and it didn't leave a purple tone once we rinsed it out. However, it didn't give us the icy look we'd had in mind, and we wish it were more pigmented. It might be a better bet if you're going for a warmer, buttery blonde shade versus an ashy hue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Recommended Use: </strong>Not specified<strong>｜Scent: </strong>Light and fresh<strong>｜Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes<strong>｜Size: </strong>9.46 fl. oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-clairol-professional-shimmer-lights-purple-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hHVrjWfN4dM6NnUz3ElavKkdzZs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/clairol-professional-shimmer-lights-shampoo-f5dac0eecbf6411085ecb067bdd7220d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It offers great results at an even better value.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The scent is polarizing.

And while we've tried purple shampoos before, we've found that they've been too heavy for our fine hair. That's not the case with this one, which has a reputation among colorists for being really good.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We needed to use quite a bit of it to get it to lather well, but it did the trick to clean our hair without drying it out. We had to thoroughly rinse it to get rid of any residue, but otherwise we didn't see any irritation or staining on our hair. Throughout the entire testing period, <strong>our hair stayed vibrantly blonde</strong>, and we actually thought that it prolonged our dye job.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our only concern was that our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curtain bangs</a>, which is the most porous part of our hair, looked almost silvery-blue. But once we cut down on how long we let the shampoo sit, that stopped being an issue. We also didn't love the smell — we found it off-putting but it wasn't strong enough to stop using it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Recommended Use: </strong>Twice a week<strong>｜Scent: </strong>Spicy floral<strong>｜Sulfate-Free: </strong>No<strong>｜Size: </strong>16 fl. oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-gray-hair-better-not-younger-silver-lining-purple-brightening-shampoo-for-grey--white-hair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Gray Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Better Not Younger Silver Lining Purple Brightening Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Better Not Younger Silver Lining Purple Brightening Shampoo for Grey &amp;amp; White Hair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/H1HjofWuNOuf3Gz9ESK8mSkB4dU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/better-not-younger-silver-lining-purple-brightening-shampoo-for-grey--white-hair-f52b71b8cd1e44f69c17f9b620f14795.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Better Not Younger</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It actively hydrated and repaired hair, controlling frizz and leaving it more manageable.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The bottle was hard to open, and the usage instructions were unclear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Graying is part of the aging process, and while it can be hard to accept, this shampoo — which we found to be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best for silver hair </a>— can make it a little easier. Roughly 90% of our hair is gray at this point, and we'd been told that it had a brassy, yellow tone. We began using this twice in the shower, washing, rinsing, and repeating. It calmed our scalp, cleaned our hair, and, despite our shampooing twice, <strong>left our hair soft and touchable</strong>. It rinsed out quickly and easily, and there were no purple stains left in our hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That said, we do wish we were told how long we had to leave it in for, eventually settling on four minutes. But the formula, infused with biotin, burdock, and hops, managed to do more than make <strong>our gray hair look brighter</strong> and healthier; now, the shampoo has left it silky and more manageable, and even <strong>less frizzy</strong> on humid days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we found opening the bottle to be tricky — and it's more of an investment than our previous purple shampoo — we really loved how our hair looked with this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Recommended Use: </strong>1-2 times a week<strong>｜Scent: </strong>Fresh and floral<strong>｜Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes<strong>｜Size: </strong>8.4 fl. oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-bleached-hair-amika-bust-your-brass-cool-blonde-repair-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Bleached Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amika Bust Your Brass Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amika Bust Your Brass Cool Blonde Repair Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bnv-OMHm_T6IapP21OfIJ6qqUOo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AmikaBustYourBrassCoolBlondeRepairShampoo-29f16af360414c16857ba97709a516c3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It seemed to actually nourish and repair hair as it works.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> We had to experiment with different timeframes to determine how long to leave it in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After we bleached our naturally black hair ash-blonde, we needed a shampoo that could maintain our shade effectively without stripping hair of moisture. We were a little intimidated by the highly pigmented purple color of the shampoo, but so far, it hasn't stained a thing — not our skin, not our towels, and not even our hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We had to experiment with how long to leave it in, eventually settling on <strong>three minutes</strong>. But immediately after our first use, we were floored by <strong>how soft our hair felt</strong> and how quickly the formula rinsed out. Our hair was recovering from the bleaching process, but instead of feeling crunchy and dry, it felt <strong>nourished and healthy</strong>. We followed it with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hydrating hair mask</a>, and couldn't get over that it restored our hair to the cool, frosty blonde that we had when we left the salon.

To see if this might be the best for balayage, we used it <strong>once a week</strong>, lathering and rinsing without leaving it on our hair. While we were skeptical — even the instructions don't specify any amount of time to leave it on — it helped lift some brassiness from our hair even without leaving it in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved how well it lathered, too, <strong>creating more of a foam</strong> than other purple-shampoo formulas we'd used in the past. It rinsed out easily and without any residue, but our hair and scalp didn't feel dry — just really clean. In fact, we loved how it made our scalp feel, and it seemed like it <strong>brightened our blonde</strong>, cut down brassiness, and even left our hair <strong>more hydrated and less frizzy</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We did find that the purple formula stained a few spots in our shower where we didn't immediately rinse it off the wall, so we'll take that as a lesson to clean up sooner.

There was <strong>no staining</strong> on our hands or shower. While the shampoo did leave our hair a little dry and frizzy, the conditioner took care of it, leaving it <strong>soft and shiny</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Together they worked well — almost too well, really, because it not only seemed to remove the brassiness, but seemed to lighten our hair too much.

We're delighted by how well this formula worked: this lathered well, rinsed easily, and left our <strong>hair feeling clean and residue-free</strong>. And despite being a dark purple color, it didn't leave any telltale stains on our sower or hands, either. We loved that it gave our hair an icy-blonde appearance, and the floral scent was a nice touch (it might be the best smelling purple shampoo we’ve ever used).

While we were stumped on how long to leave it in our hair and how often to use it — since the directions were really vague — we eventually got into a routine of using this every other wash to maintain our results without turning our highlights purple.

Maybe that's why we were so shocked by the <strong>instant results </strong>of this shampoo. Just by dispensing it, we were surprised and a little intimidated by the deep, dark purple of the shampoo. It left some light (but temporary) staining on our nails, but we didn't have any issues with our hands or shower tiles. We let it <strong>sit for five minutes</strong>, as the directions said, during which we exfoliated and shaved our legs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As soon as we got out of the shower, we could see a difference in the tone of our hair; our natural color is a very golden tone, and our highlights tend to <strong>turn yellow</strong>. After those five minutes, the shampoo restored our highlights <strong>back to their original tone</strong>. Not only is it the most powerful purple shampoo we've used, but it's also the fastest to work, making a big difference after one wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only thing we didn't love is that our hair felt rough and coarse when we went to rinse it out.

The extra time was worth it, since the shampoo worked so well to <strong>counteract the brassy tones</strong> of our hair that we felt more confident in the weeks leading up to our next color appointment. (That said, it wasn't too powerful, and it didn't leave our hair too cool or purple.) It was also <strong>lightweight</strong>, and didn’t leave any residue weighing down our <strong>fine, thin hair</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And the formula was really nourishing, so we didn't feel like we had to compromise our hair health to get the color we wanted.

We also didn't love that the shampoo removed the spray tan from our hands, which was a little frustrating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Recommended Use: </strong>Not specified<strong>｜Scent: </strong>Floral<strong>｜Sulfate-Free: </strong>Yes<strong>｜Size: </strong>8.5 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Sulfate-Free Formulas:</strong> Sulfates used to be the status quo in shampoo formulas, since they serve as surfactants that help lift grease, product buildup, and debris from the scalp. However, a sulfate-free shampoo is “<strong>more gentle on the hair</strong>, especially color-treated hair,” says Los Angeles-based colorist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Meri Kate O’Connor</a>. “Sulfate-free will <strong>prevent fading</strong> and help to keep the integrity of the color.” The downside, however, is that sulfates tend to contribute to the lather; without them, the shampoo might be harder to distribute.</li><li><strong>Nourishing + Non-Stripping Ingredients: </strong>Along with leaving out sulfates, swap any stripping ingredients for those that actively <strong>nourish hair</strong>. You can sometimes find <strong>squalane</strong> infused into formulas, as with IGK’s shampoo, or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2><strong>hyaluronic acid</strong></a>, which helps draw in and retain hydration. These moisturizing ingredients offer bonus points, especially since color-treated hair tends to be more damaged and therefore drier than untreated hair. “Especially if you only use purple shampoo, you want to make sure you don’t skimp on good ingredients to maintain the health of your hair,” says O’Connor.</li><li><strong>Don't Overdo It:</strong> Slow and steady wins the purple-shampoo race. Purple shampoos can be potent, since they’re literally <strong>infused with pigment particles</strong>. That means that if you use too much, or apply it too frequently, they could leave blonde and gray hair with a telltale purple hue. “The more you use it, the more deposit it can give — making the hair appear ashier than expected,” says O’Connor. If that happens, you can use a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>clarifying shampoo</a> to remove it. Or, “if it’s really strong, your hairstylist can remove it with a treatment,” she says.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What does purple shampoo do?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Purple shampoo eliminates and neutralizes unwanted brass on the hair,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Michelle Hong</a>, colorist and founder of NYC The Team. It contains purple pigments that counteract the warm yellow or orange tones that can appear in blonde or color-treated hair; they can also lend an ashier appearance to people with gray or brown hair, too.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you use purple shampoo?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re a beginner, use it sparingly. “Mix the shampoo with regular shampoo and see how the result is,” says O’Connor. “If you want more you can always use all or more purple and less to non regular shampoo.” Once you get the hang of it, you can figure out a ratio that works for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also, you don’t need it right after your color treatment. Wait until four to six weeks after your color appointment, which is when the color starts to oxidize, says Hong. And keep in mind that “the ends of your hair are dry and more porous, so try to only run the shampoo through quickly on the ends, as it will grab the color faster,” she says. (In other words, your tone could look uneven if you apply it through your strands.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you use purple shampoo?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The exact amount depends on the formula, so follow the directions.

And since they can leave a stain on your hair, she recommends telling your colorist that you use it before you get any additional color services. That way, they can keep an eye out for (and account for) any discoloration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also, keep in mind that the effect is temporary. “Purple shampoo aids in helping brassy and yellow tones, but it isn’t a permanent solution,” says O’Connor. “If you find that you are constantly using it with little to no results, you may need to see your colorist for a more permanent solution, like a toner or gloss.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Deanna Pai</a> is a freelance writer and editor who has been covering beauty, health, and wellness for more than a decade.
