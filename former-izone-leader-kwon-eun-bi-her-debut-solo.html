Now she’s the first one to begin a solo career after the group’s break-up earlier this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I feel good overall, but I have a lot of weight on my shoulders about needing to show my own colours. It’s my first time, so I’m trying to show myself as best as I can to everyone,” she says over a video call from Seoul ahead of the release of her first EP, Open, on August 24, which is fronted by the single Door.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As a member of IZ*ONE, Kwon was associated with the colour purple, but that’s not one of the three colours she thinks describes her style as a soloist. “First is red!” she declares. “White and black too. Because I have a lot of passion, so red, while white is for purity and prettiness, but also there’s a sense of chicness, so that’s the black.”</p>IZ*ONE was formed as a multi-year, but temporary, K-pop girl group through the competition television programme Produce 48. Although the show, and IZ*ONE’s final lineup, was <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">ultimately determined to have been rigged</span></a>, the band saw a lot of love from the very start of their career until the end of it, and each of the dozen Korean and Japanese women who were part of it have become celebrity darlings.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Kwon is the first one to release a solo album, anticipation is high about what others will do, especially as there is talk of several members joining subsidiaries of Hybe Corp., the label of superstar K-pop boy band BTS.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the song Rain, also known as Rainy Road in Korean, there’s a line, “You won’t disappear even if you’re rained on.” While the song, which she co-wrote, is about an ex-lover, the line feels representative of Kwon’s struggle to get where she is now: while IZ*ONE was Kwon’s highest-profile project to date, she had previously been part of another girl group, Ye-A, which released their first and only single in 2014, when she was a teenager.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I created that song really thinking about its performance style, and wanting to show a side to myself I had never shown beforeKwon Eun Bi on her single Door</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now 25 years old and on the third stage of her career, Kwon admits to feeling some stress and anxiety, as well as excitement, while preparing for her first solo release after everything that’s preceded it, but felt the support of fans online as they anticipated the arrival of Door.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Open is meant to show the world who Kwon Eun Bi is as a soloist, but she carries all her previous work experience with her. “I feel like [throughout it all] my mindset has changed, and I’ve learned to accept things. I’ve grown stronger, like a tree [growing up from a seedling].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwon took a hands-on role in planning the album from its early stages, and has lyric writing credits on another of the six tracks in addition to the funky, electro-swing Door.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I created that song really thinking about its performance style, and wanting to show a side to myself I had never shown before. ‘I can suit anything, I can sing anything, I can show you guys anything’, that’s what was on my mind while creating Door,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a songwriter, when working on songs for IZ*ONE as a group, I really drew on my imagination, but as a solo artist I drew on my life and also some books.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the case of Door, she thought about children’s books, and the music video from the song features an Alice In Wonderland concept. She also was inspired by the books of South Korean pop-culture critic Hee A Park, including one that features a series of interviews with different celebrities, which Kwon says she knows many K-pop idols have also read.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/08/28/7ff67da5-66d8-48de-b998-fcbee33ff01b_2d7624af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One question Kwon thought about a lot based on those celebrity interviews was, “Are you content with your own life?” At the moment, on the verge of this new Open-ing, she says she’s about 60 per cent content.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to fill that other 40 per cent with my skills as I improve and grow. Every day I’m always feeling that need to get better. Right now, I’m focusing especially on developing as a singer since now I’m a soloist. It’s so much more difficult, I really felt while working on this album that all the solo artists out there are really amazing people.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kwon feels she has grown from the experience of creating her first solo release. The album is a new beginning for her as a soloist, but represents the culmination of her determination to become a successful pop star.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I was a trainee, I only had one goal, to debut. When I was in IZ*ONE, my goal was to be loved by everyone. Now, since I’ve debuted and since I now am receiving love, I want to make my own music, and that’s what I’m trying to do right now. Just trying to show off ‘Kwon Eun Bi, myself’ through my songs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZpqqpJ7Atb%2BMnJylnZKntrW1xKxmmqqknrCtsY5saG1uZ2l9cLLOq6Seql2ex7C6xGajnpmUmr9ut9aopWadpaN6o7WMoZyrZZSar7bAjKympac%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./janet-jackson-jermaine-dupri-relationship-150441.html>&#171;&nbsp;Janet Jackson Feels Happier Than Ever Dating Former Ex Jermaine Dupri</a>
