Although he’s been in the ‘biz for a number of years, the recent surge of interest around the movie Saltburn has led to fans discovering the actor for the first time. He’s appeared in a number of big blockbusters, but it was his former co-star who somehow eerily predicted Barry Keoghan would go on to play The Joker in Batman – years before he did.</strong></p><p>We all love a creepy fortune-telling type of story, and it’s even better when it’s about a <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star. The Killing of a Sacred Deer <a href=#>movie</a> star, Barry Keoghan, was once told by his co-star Colin Farrell that he’d play The Joker years before it was even in production. Who knew Colin had this strange power to somehow predict the future?</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hollywood-star-lived-with-colin-farrell-while-filming>Hollywood star lived with Colin Farrell while filming</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-686940156-648x1024.jpg><p>The duo have actually been in three films together so far and formed a strong relationship off-screen. They were both cast in The Killing of a Sacred Deer (201), The Banshees of Inisherin and The Batman (2022).</p><p>Keoghan, from Summerhill in Dublin, in the same greater area as his <a href=#>celebrity</a> counterpart Farrell. It probably helped the pair form a friendship away from the camera as well.</p><p>Barry spoke about his most predominant roles so far in an interview with GQ, where he also confessed to what it was like temporarily living with his co-star.</p><p>Barry and Farrell lived together for The Banshees of Inisherin, with the younger star admitting there were times when things would get awkward between them. No bad blood between the celebrities, he was referring to the usual friction you may find living with anyone – leaving the toilet seat up and not closing the refrigerator door, of all things.</p><p>We’re glad they managed to get through it, though.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-barry-keoghan-was-told-he-would-play-the-joker-fives-years-before-getting-the-part>Barry Keoghan was told he would ‘play The Joker’ fives years before getting the part</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>It was his Hollywood pal Colin who predicted Barry Keoghan would go on to play The Joker.</p><p>The 31-year-old was casted as the fanatic in the latest reboot of the comic hero franchise alongside <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a>.</p><p>Barry says in the <a href=#>YouTube</a> clip, it was when the duo were filming The Killing of a Sacred Deer when Colin made the prediction. He said he was so impressed by his performance of Martin Lang, he’s “gonna probably play the Joker one day after this character”.</p><p>Goosebumps, anyone?</p><p>Colin ended up playing the Penguin in The Batman as well, maybe he had a feeling about his own future too?</p><p>Barry also confessed he had made an audition tape to play the Riddler – which ended up being played by Paul Dano (think Dumb Money, Little Miss Sunshine and There Will Be Blood). He said he dressed up and tried his best acting as the character for his attempt to get the movie bosses’ attention.</p><p>It did, but they spoke to Barry Keoghan about playing The Joker instead.</p><p>The Joker scene cameo was shrouded in mystery. The discussion between the Dark Knight and the prisoner was cut from the movie, but later released as a deleted scene and sent fans into a frenzy. They began connecting the dots that the character – credited simply as ‘unseen Arkham prisoner’ – was The Joker, offering new theories on what would happen in the second installment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-next-batman-movie-is-on-the-way>The next Batman movie is on the way</h2><p>Batman Part II is on the way, and is set to grace cinema screens next year. It’s believed there will be another trilogy, following Christian Bale’s three movies of the comic book series.</p><p>However, Barry Keoghan’s role of The Joker hasn’t been confirmed yet as part of the cast. Maybe the scene being deleted was a premonition from the director Matt Reeves and the scriptwriter Mattson Tomlin. Or perhaps they didn’t want to give the game away.</p><p>Barry himself has been tight-lipped about whether he’s been called in, so there’s no teaser there.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2FcK7Aq6myZZuavKi0wKdkraecmXqpsculZKmkka56tbTEZqGoo5WnerqxwKuqZpqVm7yzsYyipWabopqyscWMqamenJmYwaq7zWg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./claire-kellett-wiki-age-husband-pregnant-salary-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Claire Kellett Wiki, Age, Husband, Pregnant, Salary</a>
