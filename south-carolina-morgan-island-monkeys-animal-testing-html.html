Visitors üêí Where is a forbidden place you would like to visit? Morgan Island is a 4,489-acre marshland island in Beaufort County, South Carolina, United States. It is also known as Monkey Island due to its colony of free-ranging rhesus monkeys, established in 1979. The island is uninhabited, and the only people allowed on the island are researchers who tag the monkeys, and take 500 per year from their home for medical testing. <a title=travel rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>#Travel</a> <a title=learning rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>#Learning</a> <a title=educational rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>#Educational</a> <a title=animals rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>#Animals</a> <a title=adventure rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>#Adventure</a> The monkeys were brought to Morgan Island after a herpes B virus outbreak at a research facility in Puerto Rico. The island was chosen because it is isolated and has a similar climate to Puerto Rico. The monkeys have thrived on the island, and their population has grown to over 4,000. The monkeys on Morgan Island are used for a variety of medical research, including studies on vaccines, polio, AIDS, and bioterrorism. The research is important for developing new treatments and vaccines for these diseases. The island is off-limits to the public, and there are strict regulations in place to protect the monkeys. Visitors are not allowed to set foot on the island, and boats are not allowed to come within 500 yards of the shore. Morgan Island is a unique and important place. The monkeys on the island are helping to advance medical research, and they deserve to be protected. Here are some additional facts about Morgan Island: The island is located in the ACE Basin, a protected estuary that is home to a variety of wildlife. The monkeys on Morgan Island are Indian-origin rhesus monkeys, which are a type of Old World monkey. The monkeys are free-ranging, which means they are not kept in cages. They live in the forests and marshes on the island. The monkeys are monitored by researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The monkeys are used for a variety of medical research, including studies on vaccines, polio, AIDS, and bioterrorism. The island is off-limits to the public, and there are strict regulations in place to protect the monkeys.</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - DareToGoTravel" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - DareToGoTravel</a><p class=mol-para-with-font>Since then, the colony has grown but numbers have been largely contained due to the fact that up to 600 monkeys are taken away each year for animal testing purposes.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to the&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Post and Courier</a>, 'no testing is done on the island itself' and 'instead, monkeys are sent to researchers working on vaccines and medical treatments.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While the island is owned by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, the colony is managed by the federal National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A private company is hired for the actual care of the animals, with this contract worth several million dollars a year.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Members of the public are forbidden from stepping foot on the island and it is only accessible to trained researchers.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But for those who wish to get close to the island, there are several outfitters running boat tours, with the route running around the periphery.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel=nofollow href=#>Low Country Tidal Tours</a>&nbsp;runs a Morgan Island tour for $250 plus gratuity and it says it is one of their most requested trips.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The tour company notes: 'Morgan Island itself has a fascinating story and seeing rhesus monkeys in the low country landscape is nothing short of surreal.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-53180f8f2cbc6139 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/22/18/81594441-13113649-Members_of_the_public_are_forbidden_from_stepping_foot_on_the_is-m-114_1708627263956.jpg height=483 width=634 alt="Members of the public are forbidden from stepping foot on the island and it is only accessible to trained researchers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Members of the public are forbidden from stepping foot on the island and it is only accessible to trained researchers</p><img id=i-7dd7ccc11b68d370 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/22/15/81582221-13113649-image-a-104_1708614229406.jpg height=357 width=634 alt="For those who wish to get close to the island, there are several outfitters running boat tours, with the route running around the periphery" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>For those who wish to get close to the island, there are several outfitters running boat tours, with the route running around the periphery</p><img id=i-d30279d047ee303d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/22/18/81582227-13113649-A_private_company_is_hired_for_the_actual_care_of_the_animals_wi-m-113_1708627249532.jpg height=541 width=634 alt="A private company is hired for the actual care of the animals, with this contract worth several million dollars a year" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>A private company is hired for the actual care of the animals, with this contract worth several million dollars a year</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To date, the tour has been deemed as 'excellent' by all reviewers on&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel=nofollow href=#>Tripadvisor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One tourist wrote: 'We took a trip to Morgan Island to see the monkeys.
