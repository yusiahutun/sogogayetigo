Lisa explained that the bride's partner asking her father for permission to marry her can seem a little antiquated in today's society, but some still view this – as well as the act of him giving her away – as a sweet way to keep family member's involved.</p><p id=e5WGEmYm7Qec data-wc=46>"When you look back, these traditions are based on ancient Roman customs and the days of arranged marriages. At the time, women were considered property, so it symbolises the act of the father literally giving his daughter to a new owner - usually for a price.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c79b71caa748-meghan-markle-aisle-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e0xhYepLTAHy data-wc=7><strong>Meghan Markle walked herself down the aisle</strong></p><p id=eoHYYIazQc-P data-wc=42>"Of course, in the 21st century, women aren't seen as property, and there is no reason for a father to allow his daughter to marry or 'give' his daughter to another man - and definitely not in exchange for money!" she explained.</p><p id=ehUzC4XiuEzt data-wc=44>Both of these may be here to stay, though. Lisa added: "But it's still a very common tradition 21st-century brides uphold. Today it may be seen more as a sign of respect for your father or a way to include them in the celebrations.</p><p id=eOeTt9Cyh8X0 data-wc=39>"Some see the tradition of being given away by your father as outdated, but many of our couples at Tree of Hearts still see it as a staple of your wedding day and still incorporate it into their ceremony."</p><p id=eMOKWac7ST8G data-wc=60><a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan Markle</a> was the first royal British bride to walk herself to the Quire of St George’s Chapel, where she was met by&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Charles</a> for her final steps to now-husband&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a>.

Why would you want to throw such a keepsake away rather than, say, drying it and keeping it?" Lisa said – and we totally agree!</p><p id=eYF3OGLAcEOy data-wc=86>"The tradition of the bouquet toss started when it was considered good luck to simply touch the bride on her wedding day.&nbsp;Single girls would often try to touch the bride in the hopes that a little bit of the bride's luck would rub off on them. Legend says that some single women would even go as far as to try and take home keepsakes of the bride's wedding dress as she was walking by. To escape, the bride would often toss the bouquet and run.</p><p id=eBK7vKs41hrY data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Girl power! 8 queens and princesses who are proud feminists" class=hm-link href=#>Girl power! 8 queens and princesses who are proud feminists</a></strong></p><p id=efzpDRWRYZyx data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="4 outdated wedding traditions brides and grooms are ditching in 2022" class=hm-link href=#>4 outdated wedding traditions brides and grooms are ditching in 2022</a></strong></p><p id=eFJd9-k4Awf2 data-wc=45>"Of course, women in the 21st century have far bigger goals than simply being married so touching the bride is less of a concern.

Lisa explains all.</p><p id=ekRJXUM89aQB data-wc=50>"While it's suggested this is the bride and groom's 'last night of freedom' before marriage, most couples in the 21st century have had years of freedom by the time they come to tying the knot and their retrospective pre-wedding parties are just an excuse for a fun time with friends.</p><p id=ey8FoLaLLc9w data-wc=30>"In recent years it's become popular for groups to come together for a 'sten' party rather than a separate stag and hen, given so many couples have shared friendship groups."</p><p id=e-HsqMDCBkpz data-wc=50>She added that it's ultimately up to the couple: "It's all about choice, we don't think there’s any harm in having separate hen and stag parties if that's what you want. If you want a joint party or you don't want one at all, it's your wedding and your choice!"</p><p id=e1YK1-RrRUPT data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Who should pay for your wedding?
