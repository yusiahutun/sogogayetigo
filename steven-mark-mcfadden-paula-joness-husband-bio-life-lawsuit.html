She claimed that her meeting with Clinton occurred two months after joining the job.</p><p>She claimed that the incident took place when Clinton visited the Conference at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock.&nbsp;</p><p>He observed her manning a conference table and tried to expose himself to her during a conference.&nbsp;</p><p>Clinton then made some sexual comments and also tried to sexually harass Paul with inappropriate touching.</p><p>Jones declined the overture and tried to leave. Clinton said, “You are smart. Keep this between us.”</p><p>Federal district court judge Susan Webber Wright granted judgment in favor of Clinton&nbsp;</p><p>She stated that even if the alleged incidents had happened, they did not amount to sexual assault.
