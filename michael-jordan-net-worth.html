An important part of the deal was the clause requiring Nike to spend at least a million dollars in total promoting the products – to make sure the name ”Michael Jordan” was widely publicized”</p><p>In 1997, Nike made the Jordan Brand.

And he told me that from the time he was a youngster in the league, he did seek out Michael’s advice,” the documentary’s director, Jason Hehir, told The Score.</p><p>Hehir added, “And then for Michael to make the speech at <a href=#>Kobe’s memorial service</a> and from his perspective call him his little brother, it was just so poignant.”</p><h2>What charities does Michael Jordan donate to?</h2><p>What charities does Michael Jordan donate to?
