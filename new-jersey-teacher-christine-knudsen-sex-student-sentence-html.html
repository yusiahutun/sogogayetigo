parole,' Remson added.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm also going to execute the Nicole's Law restraining order, and you'll be given a copy of that in just a moment as well.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Donning a face mask for the proceedings, Knudsen could be heard sniffling during the judge's statement, which referenced a federal law that forbids her to have any contact with the victim, who is now at least 22.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You are to have no contact with the victim, whose initials are NK - of course you know who that is,' reiterated Remson, in a spiel that would eventually see her cut the disgraced educator some slack.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You're barred from her residence, school, place of employment, [and] you're prohibited from having any oral, written, personal, telephonic, electronic or any other form of contact with her,' the judge added.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-65409759b4fdcf34

threatening the victim.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Do you understand that?' she asked - to which Knudsen, seated next to her attorney, replied, 'Yes, Your Honor.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You've already surrendered you're teaching certificate, which is ordered as part of this sentence,' added&nbsp;Remson, before calling the hearing - and case - to a close.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, she first referenced allegations that suggested the educator consumed&nbsp;controlled substances with the student, whom she fessed up becoming acquainted with while heading a drama club where the victim was a member.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prosecutors did not publicly release more information about the drugs or what they were, but accused&nbsp;the graphic arts teacher of 'providing and ingesting [the] controlled dangerous substances with the student.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'm also going to have you a have a task evaluation, which is to assess whether you need any treatment for substance abuse, given what I've seen in the sentence report,' said&nbsp;Remson during the sentencing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I don't know if that's an issue presently, but it was referred to in the report that there was some past conduct that was troubling in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'So, if there's any treatment recommended, you are to comply with that treatment.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Remson conceded the relationship would have technically been legal, if it it had not occurred in a school setting between an instructor and student.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That's because the victim was 17 at the time, and of the age of consent in the Garden State is 17.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That said, given the context of&nbsp;Knudsen's crimes and her position of power over the teen, the victim was considered a child for the admitted sex offender's sentencing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Parents send their kids to school every day, trusting they will be safe in the care of their teachers,' Remson said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And there is a very strong need to deter not only Ms. Knudsen but all citizens from violations of the law, especially in this nature involving a breach of trust between the teacher and the student.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The jurist added children can be easily influenced, especially with someone older and in a position of authority as&nbsp;Knudsen had
