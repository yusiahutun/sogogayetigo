With various successful shows and books to his name, how much is he worth? Read on to find out.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve Harvey was born Broderick Steven Harvey on January 17, 1957, in Welch, West Virginia. He was the youngest to five children by his parents, father Jesse, a coal miner, and mother, Eloise Harvey.</p><p>While still a young child, his parents moved the family to Cleveland. There, Harvey enrolled in Glenville high school before he graduated in 1974.&nbsp;After high school, he attended Kent State University but left before graduating. Afterward, he returned to Cleveland to find whatever work he could to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/c1/67/1a/c1671aaf3ad5a2451b6616b00dfce52f.jpg><p>Harvey <a href=#>spent </a>most of his 20s trying his hands at various jobs, including selling insurance. He also worked as a postman and a wannabe boxer.&nbsp;He found his calling in 1985 when he performed stand-up comedy for the first time winning an amateur contest.</p><p>Harvey decided stand-up comedy was what he wanted to do, so he started honing his skills. He performed mainly on the road and at any club that would allow him.&nbsp;In 1989 he came close to making his mark in the comedy scene when he made it to the finals of the Second edition of the Annual Johnnie Walker National Comedy Search.&nbsp;In 1993 he took over as the host of Showtime at the Apollo, a variety show filmed at the iconic Apollo Theatre in Harlem.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%9CThe_Steve_Harvey_Show%E2%80%9D_and_Continued_Success></span><strong>“The Steve Harvey</strong> <strong>Show” and Continued Success</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1996 the comedian landed his sitcom “The Steve Harvey Show.” It became one of the first shows to become successful on the Warner Bros Network.&nbsp;Harvey met up-and-coming young comedian Cedric the Entertainer on the sitcom, where the latter played his best friend.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The pair would later collaborate on a comedy tour titled “The Kings of Comedy.” Comedians Bernie Mac and D.L Hughley joined and together made the comedy tour a nationwide hit. “The Kings of Comedy” created a new record, becoming the highest-grossing comedy tour ever, bringing in more than $19 million.</p><p>Harvey hosted “Showtime at the Apollo” till 2000, and his sitcom “The Steve Harvey Show,” which drew large numbers of African-American audiences, aired till 2002. The comedian’s role as the MC during the Kings of Comedy tour remains his most iconic in an entertainment career. He has also hosted many other famous shows, including “The Steve Harvey Morning Show” and “Family Feud.”</p><p>In 2009 the famous Comedian became the best-selling author of relationship advice books, including “Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man” and “Straight Talk, No Chaser.” The former was later <a href=#>adapted</a> into a movie titled “Think Like a Man.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Steve_Harveys_Net_Worth></span><strong>Steve Harvey’s Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although growing up, Steve Harvey did not initially view Comedy as a job, since he took up the profession, he has become one of the wealthiest and most successful comedians of all time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/c4/60/58/c460585712efdd465e97c09f78dd51a5.jpg><p>According to Wealthy Gorilla, as of 2022, Steve Harvey’s net worth<a href=#> sits</a> at $200 million. The actor, comedian, and writer have done very well for himself commercially.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Comedian_Was_Once_Homeless></span><strong>The Comedian Was Once Homeless</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Steve Harvey’s net worth makes him one of the richest celebrities on earth while undoubtedly holding many expensive properties. Still, at a certain point earlier in his life, the comedian was dead <a href=#>broke</a> and homeless.&nbsp;</p><p>After separating from his wife Mercia during the late 80s, he mailed most of his paychecks home for his kids, and after some future gigs fell through, the comedian experienced homelessness.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/87/ab/d0/87abd025df7d9e3149f2a9eceed5c9a8.jpg><p>He occasionally <a href=#>stayed</a> in hotels rented for him whenever he had a show, but after the gig ended, the comedian had to make do with living in his makeshift 1976 Ford Tempo.&nbsp;</p><p>Harvey turned an Igloo container in the backseat into a makeshift refrigerator, washed up in hotel bathrooms, gas stations, or swimming pool showers.&nbsp;The comedian lived like this for three years before finally landing the role of host on “Showtime at the Apollo,” which changed his fortunes.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Multiple_Marriages></span><strong>His Multiple Marriages</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harvey has pretty much had a steady career ever since his rise to fame during the early 90s; however, his personal life has not been smooth sailing.&nbsp;Although the comedian has been <a href=#>married </a>to his current wife, Marjorie Bridges, since 2007, he had been married twice before walking down the aisle with her.&nbsp;</p><p>He married his first wife, Mercia Harvey, in 1981 while working as an insurance salesman in Ohio. Not long after he decided to be a full-time comedian, Harvey spent long periods on the road honing his skills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/85/ee/b2/85eeb2c32b69801ecdf3047a608c952f.jpg><p>Spending so much time away from home without his wife strained their marriage which ultimately led to their divorce in 1994.&nbsp;Harvey was already seeing his second wife, Mary Shackleford, before his divorce from Mercia was finalized. The pair exchanged marital vows in 1996 and divorced in 2005, but unlike his first divorce from Mercia, this proved to be a little dramatic.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011 a judge rebuked her for making false statements about Harvey. Mary has also made countless accusations against Harvey since claiming he cheated on her with his wife, Marjorie.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Harveys_Current_Project></span><strong>Harvey’s Current Project</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harvey is currently <a href=#>appearing</a> as both judge and jury on the comedy court reality series “Judge Steve Harvey,” where real-life people with actual conflicts present their cases to him, ranging from family disputes to unpaid debts, sour friendships, etc.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>However, unlike other famous TV judges, Harvey has never held any judgeship or legal license and is not a real lawyer. His on-screen decisions are based on his own life experiences.&nbsp;The comedian is assisted by Nancy Price, who serves as his trusted bailiff. The first season has averaged 4.6 million viewers, and the series has been renewed for a second season by ABC Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwLWx1Z5koZmiq7K6v4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMpaCfnV2ks27Ax55kra5dnby0wIR%2BfV56dlqPhHs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./iowa-house-oks-bill-to-criminalize-death-of-an-unborn-person-despite-ivf-concerns.html>&#171;&nbsp;Iowa House OKs bill to criminalize death of an 'unborn person' despite IVF concerns</a>
