Mean this from the bottom of my heart," continuing, "</p><p>I feel overwhelmed by the outpouring of kind messages and am incredibly grateful to be surrounded by a strong community of friends, family, colleagues, and fans who have offered their support during this time; and to the team of paramedics, nurses, and doctors who saved my life,” she wrote. “I am still shocked & devastated by the loss of my friends Fu, Rico, and Natalie. Words cannot describe the pain I am feeling & I will be changed forever by their passings.”</p><p>She continued, “Fu was a generous, loving soul,” she wrote. “He was hilarious, supportive, and incredibly authentic with the most infectious spirit. Rico was always filled with enthusiasm & Natalie was so kind and endearing. They each made an indelible mark on my life and the lives of their loved ones. I will miss them."</p><p>Concluding the messages, she said, "There are so many more things I&nbsp;want to say, but I’m not ready...When I am, I will. Until then, all I can say is: Tell your people that you love them every day. Stay safe. And please don’t take life for granted. I did, and I never will again." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-604 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, she is well on her way to recovery now as she was spotted out cruising through Venice, rocking a black T-shirt and cut-off jeans accompanied by a cap, face mask, shades, and flip flops on September 15, 2021.</p><p>Kate has promised to talk more on this matter in the coming days after she finishes struggling with her situation.
