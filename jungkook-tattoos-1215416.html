ARMY tattoo</strong></h2><p>Jungkook has publicly gone ahead and shared that the ARMY tattoo was his first ever tattoo that holds a special place in his heart. It is indeed a token of gratitude for his fans. The real reason he got this tattoo on the knuckles was that he is really very proud of his ARMY and he wanted it to be in a place that is pretty visible. The <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","BTS Jungkook tattoos: A complete breakdown with meanings ","1215416","https://www.pinkvilla.com/stories/entertainment/bts-jungkook-golden-maknae-1186161","articlepage","/entertainment/jungkook-tattoos-1215416","Golden Maknae","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>Golden Maknae</a> believes he could have chosen a better font but he couldn't have ever chosen a better first tattoo.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Jungkook's ARMY tattoo; Picture Courtesy: BIGHIT MUSIC" title="Jungkook's ARMY tattoo; Picture Courtesy: BIGHIT MUSIC" width=1600 height=1066 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1680618565_jk-army-tattoo.jpg></p><p><strong>Jungkook’s multiple hand tattoos</strong></p><p>While the ARMY Jungkook tattoo pretty evidently expresses his love for his fans, Jungkook has several other interesting tattoos on his hand expressing a similar devotion to his fans and the band.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.<strong> J tattoo</strong></h2><p>Jungkook has a J inked on his ring finger of the right hand which adds an adorable meaning to his famous ARMY tattoo. Without a doubt, this has to be one of the most striking Jungkook tattoos. While fans have always known “ARMY” on his knuckles has more than one meaning. Yes, one has to be the famous BTS fandom name ARMY while the other one is devoted to other BTS members. Scroll on to take inspiration from this BTS friendship tattoo.</p><p>Here’s how,</p><p>“A” which is also an inscription for an inverted V as it has no line in the middle stands for Taehyung aka V.&nbsp; “RM” stands for Kim Nam Joon which is his stage name and “MY” indicates the initials of Suga’s name, <strong>M</strong>in <strong>Y</strong>oon-g. The J on his ring finger adds up to the M on his knuckle and spells JM which indicates Jimin whereas J also stands for Jungkook, Jin, as well as J-Hope.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2>3. <strong>Purple Heart&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jungkook has a beautiful purple heart inked on his right hand. While he has expressed that the tattoo stands for “I love you,” which is just another tattoo expressing love for his fans. The singer was first seen with the tattoo on September 19, 2019. When it comes to fan speculations, they have always believed the heart symbolizes love and affection. It must be noted that a purple heart generally has a negative connotation, it usually is referred to portray an unhappy relationship, betrayal, or a fear of betrayal.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. <strong>The Crown Tattoo</strong></h2><p>Apart from the ARMY logo and the purple heart Junkgoog’s right hand’s index finger also has a crown tattoo. If you think about it, the tattoo is right above the A of the ARMY tattoo which only expresses his importance for the BTS fans. The crown is an indication that his ARMY and his fans are the kings. Jungkook was first seen with this tattoo on September 19, 2019, at the airport. The singer got this tattoo among others from a tattoo artist based in Geoje Island. When it comes to the general context of a crown tattoo, it is not just a pretty regal tattoo but it stands for royalty, regard and respect, and justice.&nbsp;</p><h2>5.<strong> Woozy face emoticon&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jungkook has the cutest woozy face emoticon on his middle finger which is one of his favorite tattoos. The small tattoo has usually been hard to spot but the Jungkook fans with their eagle eyes have known to spot it multiple times before Jungkook opened up about it. Fan theories suggest that the K-pop star got this tattoo for fun or perhaps there is a tattoo story Jungkook wants to keep to himself.&nbsp;</p><h2>6.<strong> 0613</strong></h2><p>Another iconic hand tattoo Jungkook has talked about is his 0613 tattoo. As BTS fans already know, this special tattoo is a date that represents the date of the day BTS debuted, which is June 13. If you are willing to commemorate any special date in your life, take inspiration from this Jungkook tattoo and get yourself a <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","BTS Jungkook tattoos: A complete breakdown with meanings ","1215416","https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/beauty/small-tattoo-ideas-1159560","articlepage","/entertainment/jungkook-tattoos-1215416","minimal yet meaningful tattoo","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>minimal yet meaningful tattoo</a> that holds special importance to you.

In fact, he has been a fan of sleeve tattoos as he has several meaningful tattoos on his sleeves. Most of the tattoos hold special meanings to him that are integrated with each other. In fact, Jungkook has gotten himself a number of tattoos which he even got partially covered.&nbsp;</p><h2>7. <strong>The Date he came to Seoul</strong></h2><p>Jungkook has gone ahead and publicly shared that he had the date when he came to Seoul for the very first time inked on his forearm.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. <strong>Life motto and the Nirvana song</strong></h2><p>The Golden Maknae also got a quote inked on his right forearm in a crisscross fashion. It is indeed one of the best Jungkook quotes tattoos.&nbsp;He has gone ahead and shared the lines, “Rather be dead than cool and Make hay while the sun shine" which are right of a Nirvana song Stay Away which is also his life’s motto. Take inspiration from the star and pick the lines of your favorite song that hold a special meaning for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>9. <strong>Clock tattoo</strong></h2><p>Jungkook also has a spectacular clock tattoo on his forearm. He has gone ahead and explained his clock tattoo indicates the time of his birth which is somewhere around 3:23 to 3:25. Another thing that makes the clock tattoo special is the musical note and the mic connected with the clock that clearly implies that he was destined to be on stage or rather he was born to be a singer.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Jungkook Clock tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " title="Jungkook Clock tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681472225_clock-tattoo.jpg></p><h2>10. <strong>Birth Flower - Tiger Lilly&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Jungkook has been very clever and creative when it comes to picking tattoos, another amazing tattoo certainly catches our attention has to be the tattoo of his birth flower which is the Tiger Lilly. You can definitely take inspiration from the star and get yourself inked with your birth flower. Another way he makes his birth flower tattoo even more special has to be the placement of the words “Please love me” behind it. This detailed tattoo is based on his birth flower according to his birthday which is on September 1. However, flower tattoos are generally very appealing and each of them holds a special significance. Whether it is сhamomile, rose, or sunflower, you can never go wrong with a flower or a birth flower tattoo, especially on the sleeve.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="Birth Flower - Tiger Lilly tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " title="Birth Flower - Tiger Lilly tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681472298_birth-flower.jpg></p><h2>11. <strong>Chinese Letters:</strong> <strong>HYYH&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Placed near his elbow, Jungkook has a tattoo of<strong> </strong>Chinese letters that signify the words HYYH or Hwayangyeonhwa which refers to The Most Beautiful Moment in Life in English. BTS fans already know that is the title of one of the extended plays by BTS - <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","BTS Jungkook tattoos: A complete breakdown with meanings ","1215416","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-proof-most-beautiful-moment-yet-come-hints-schedule-breakdown-more-1084169","articlepage","/entertainment/jungkook-tattoos-1215416","The Most Beautiful Moment ","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>The Most Beautiful Moment </a>in Life Pt. 1 and The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 2. Hwayangyeonhwa or The HYYH was certainly a turning point in the BTS career which is why it holds special importance for him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jungkook&nbsp;tattoos - Cover ups</strong></p><p>Anyone who has a number of tattoos know, regret after getting permanent tattoos is real but so is the procedure of tattoo cover-up. While removal of tattoos is possible it is expensive and painful to some extent so tattoo artists have come up with a way to create cover-up tattoos that simply conceal an old tattoo with an attractive new tattoo. This is easier, cheaper, and gets you a new tattoo while hiding your old tattoo. Just like the rest of us, Jungkook wanted to get rid of some of his old tattoos, scroll ahead for Jungkook’s cover-up tattoos.&nbsp;</p><h2>12.<strong> Clouds</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Jungkook has opened up about one of his tattoos he got from an exciting-looking shop in the U.S. However, he also shared that the tattoo was not a great experience for him. Not only did it hurt a lot during the process, but he was also left with inflamed and damaged skin. He also added that since the tattoo was placed near his elbows, the area that stretches and dries up pretty soon, was a mess. Later, he got a cover-up tattoo from a different tattoo artist and got clouds instead.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt=" Clouds tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " title=" Clouds tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681472516_clouds-tattoo-1.jpg></p><h2>13. <strong>Lightning bolts</strong></h2><p>Jungkook has always had a thing for creative and spontaneous tattoos and the fact that he had the clouds tattooed across his arms made him want to add a few lightning bolts to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>14. <strong>The eye tattoo - Covered with a BTS song</strong></h2><p>Jungkook fans might remember, he used to have a beautiful eye tattooed on his forearm. However, he got rid of it and got himself a BTS Bulletproof tattoo.. Theories suggest that he decided to get rid of it because he got quite a negative response for it. Later, he opened up about it and shared that the only reason he got it covered up was that people never liked it. Later, he got it covered up with an eye-conic tattoo depicting the famous BTS song, titled “<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","BTS Jungkook tattoos: A complete breakdown with meanings ","1215416","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-truly-bulletproof-striking-first-concept-photos-proof-1112458","articlepage","/entertainment/jungkook-tattoos-1215416","We Are Bulletproof PT. 2","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","NA")'>We Are Bulletproof PT. 2</a>.” It is assumed that the huge red eye tattoo on JK’s forearm was inspired by an important woman in his life. However, generally, an eye tattoo signifies protection.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="The eye tattoo - Covered with a BTS song; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " title="The eye tattoo - Covered with a BTS song; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681472753_the-eye-tattoo.jpg></p><h2>15. <strong>Three stripes - Covered with a snake tattoo</strong></h2><p>JK also used to have a three stripes tattoo on his forearm. Presumably, Jungkook got that tattoo as a symbol of patriotism which depicts the national flag of Korea also known as the “Taegeuk flag”. The three stripes in the flag symbolise the East, the Sky, as well as the Spring. Along with that, there are other symbols that are depictions of harmony and balance among other important depictions. While the tattoo represented devotion towards the nation, he did not receive positive feedback for it which is why he got it covered with a magnificent snake tattoo.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Three stripes - Covered with a snake tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " title="Three stripes - Covered with a snake tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681473203_three-stripes.jpg></p><p><strong>Other BTS Jungkook tattoos&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>16. <strong>Microphone</strong></h2><p>Jungkook has been one of the most beloved Korean singers of all time and a tattoo of a microphone simply symbolizes his love and passion for music. Not too long ago, POLYC, who is a famous tattoo artist retouched JK’s microphone tattoo and shared a post on his social media.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Microphone tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " title="Microphone tattoo; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681473334_microphone-1.jpg></p><h2>17. <strong>Skeleton hand</strong></h2><p>This minimal skeleton hand tattoo doing a rock sign is another fine-line tattoo that simply represents the artist's love for rock music. Generally, skeleton-themed tattoos represent a person’s strong willpower and spontaneity. It also represents faithfulness. JK’s colorful skeleton hand tattoo was also famously retouched by POLYC. If you are looking for a minimalistic but bold tattoo, a fine-line skull hand Jungkook&nbsp;tattoo has to be your pick.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="Skeleton hand; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " title="Skeleton hand; Picture Courtesy: polyc_sj Instagram " width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-04/1681473482_skeleton-hand-1.jpg></p><p>When it comes to the latest BTS Jungkook tattoos, he has recently got himself a minimal tattoo of the number “7” behind his ear.
