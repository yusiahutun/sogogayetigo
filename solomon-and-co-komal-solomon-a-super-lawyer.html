Work towards creating a happier world and things automatically start to fall in place.</p>Ms. Komal Solomon<h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Journey to Prominence Solomon and Co.</strong></h2><p>One of the key challenges they faced was the transformation of a traditional real estate and litigation law firm into a full-service law firm.</p><p>There have been several factors amongst which focused approaches; a dedicated team has been the key element that contributed to the growth of Solomon and Co. The growth story has been gradual yet consistent; they started off with one associate, one office, and now have a staff of over 85 people spread across 3 offices in two major cities, Mumbai and Pune.</p><p>Solomon and Co. celebrates completion of 111 years.

Komal graduated from Jai Hind College and thereafter read law at the Government Law College in Mumbai. She specializes in matters relating to corporate and regulatory compliance, regulatory communications, immigration laws, entertainment, and media law, India entry strategies, and intellectual property law.</p><p>She has assisted several multinationals in establishing their subsidiaries, branch offices, and liaison offices in India.</p><p>Ms. Komal says, “Businesses are expanding in multiple directions, clients prefer out of court settlements rather than litigate endlessly in courts. Having a diversified practice helps identify risk and addresses issues holistically by structuring and offering solutions to prevent disputes at the inception of the discussion rather than on the occurrence of a default or delay or dispute.“&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to her, Mr. Bijesh Thakkar and Mr. Navin Parekh have been a true source of motivation for her since long.</p><p>Unconventional business stories have intrigued her; Ace Seafood Bazaar Private Limited and Kommune Arts Private Limited are some of the businesses that have struck as profoundly interesting to her. “Staying true to yourself, keeping your values and traditions intact, helps you to stand out from the crowd. My seniors always said, which I strongly believe in – “Ensure you shine in whatever you do. That will only happen when you put in your 100%”.&nbsp; Ms. Komal added.</p><p>Honesty and loyalty towards yourself and in the work you do is a key to success.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMCwuM6mpqdlkaOxbq%2FOZqKopZGherS7y6ikqKZdlnq0wc%2BeqWakkazGpr4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./shawn-batten.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Shawn Batten dating?
