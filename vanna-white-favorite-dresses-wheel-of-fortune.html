wardrobe is to watch the evolution of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eveningwear</a> unfold — specifically, very sparkly, extra eveningwear. In the more than 40 years that she's appeared on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Wheel of Fortune</a>, the game show hostess has sashayed across America's screens in more than 6500 gowns and never repeated a single one. She's seen the rise and fall of shoulder pads, taffeta, spaghetti straps, and a great many <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>sequins</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And yet, when asked to describe her personal style, White says, "I'm not a huge dresser-upper. Most of my closet is jeans, T-shirts, tennis shoes, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flats</a>. I don't even know if I have a sequin gown in my closet."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's partly because, in answer to the most common question White gets asked, no, she doesn't get to keep the dresses. Designers send batches of up to 50 looks to the show's stylist for rapid fittings, and on each filming day, White wears six dresses, one for each half-hour episode shot back to back. There are fashion rules, like no greens that clash with the letter screens. And White almost always pairs the dresses with her own 5-inch heels. (She's proudly mastered the art of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>comfortable footwear</a> — insider secrets below.)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Ron Slenzak</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">White, 66, has been perfecting this routine since she got the job in 1982. “I remember when I first started the show, I was sitting in the&nbsp;makeup&nbsp;chair next to Pat [Sajak], and I said to him, ‘I wonder where we’ll be in 10 years,’” she says of her longtime co-host. “Obviously Pat and I could be replaced with younger people.” But at this point, White says, her collaboration with Sajak is “just part of America.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">White was instantly embraced by the millions of viewers whose living rooms she visited every night, becoming TV’s wholesome yet glamorous, all-American personality. A&nbsp;Playboy&nbsp;cover she appeared on in 1987 briefly threatened that image, but she quickly recovered it, apologizing for the “mistake” on&nbsp;The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson. She now receives fan letters from three generations. She’s a household name and a Nelly lyric (“I be on the next flight / Paying cash; first class, sitting next to Vanna White,” the rapper sang in his 2000 song “Ride Wit Me”).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But there’s a lot to White that America has yet to get to know — like that when White is not flipping letters, she spends her time flipping houses or decorating them as vacation homes. (HGTV, meet Vanna White.) Ahead, the hostess shares her most hilarious TV wardrobe malfunctions, what Nelly said when she asked him about those lyrics, and the arm workout she does backstage before puzzles.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Ron Slenzak</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>InStyle: What was your reaction when you first heard your name in a Nelly song?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Vanna White: </strong>My kids were thrilled, like “Mom, you’re in a song!” And, of course I was excited about it too. Funny enough, I ran into him at a party and I asked him, “Did we sit next to each other on a plane?” He laughed he said, “No, it just rhymed with my song.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What’s your favorite dress you’ve ever worn on the show?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There’s one that I distinctly remember. It’s white and it has pink feathers on the bottom. [Stylist] Johnny Wujek, he brought that in. I wore a week of clothes from him and that was one of them. I don’t know why that particular dress spoke to me. I think it reminded me of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barbie dress</a> I had when I was 10 years old. And in my personal life, I’m a huge fan of&nbsp;Carolina Herrera. I just think her stuff is timeless and classic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>That feather dress looks rather difficult to walk in.&nbsp;</strong>It was! That part wasn’t my favorite, but it looked good! It was hard to walk in because there were no slits in it. But that’s OK. I survived.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Carol Kaelson</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How does the dress selection process work?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I do have some power. The way it works is the designer sends anywhere from 30-50 outfits at a time and we do 12 shows in two days. So I try on the dresses and we pick the top 12. I do have a say in those. I try to step out of the box of my own style because people watch the show to see what I’m wearing, and I want to show everything. I try them on up to a week before usually. We tend to stay away from off-the-shoulder. I can’t raise my hand to the top letter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Which trends would you have preferred to skip?&nbsp;</strong>In the ‘80s it was the big shoulder pads. When you look back at those clothes, it’s like oh my gosh! I can’t believe I wore that. There was a period of ball gowns, like big Cinderella gowns. Those I can skip.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy ABC</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What has been your worst wardrobe malfunction on TV?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well, one of the funniest was during the Christmas holidays, there was a gift-wrapped package right by where I stand, and somehow it got caught in my dress. I didn’t know it and I’m walking back and forth on the puzzle board and this gift is attached to the bottom of my dress. And Pat’s just laughing hysterically; I had no idea. Through the whole round I carried it back and forth. It went viral.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, we still take lunch breaks between shows, after the third show [of six per shooting day]. And in the old days we used to have it catered. We had Southern food like mashed potatoes and roast beef, and I would chow down. I guess one day I ate too much and I was walking down the puzzle board and my belt just popped off right in the middle of the round, it was so tight. Fortunately, nothing fell down. I just kept on going.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Another time I stepped on the hem of the dress and pulled the hem out I just had to be careful not tripping. I wear 5-inch heels on the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Is it always 5-inch heels?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It is! Every once in a while, I may get a dress from a designer that doesn’t need to be hemmed, so there’s been a few times where I’ll wear smaller heels, 2-inch, 3-inch. But most of them are 5-inch heels.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Are the shoes also borrowed from designers?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No, the shoes are mine, but I will tell you most of the shoes I wear at the studio are not expensive shoes because do you know how many miles I’ve walked in them?! And I’m not going to buy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Louboutin shoes</a> to wear on the show when it’s underneath a full-length gown. I’ll wear those at home, with jeans [laughs].</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtesy of Carol Kaelson</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What’s the trick to finding elegant yet comfortable&nbsp;shoes?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The ones that have platforms in the front. Guess makes good ones.&nbsp;They’re high heels but they have a 2-inch platform&nbsp;in the front, so it’s almost like you’re walking on 3-inch heels and not 5-inch heels. I probably have more Guess shoes than any other. Another one that I really like that’s comfortable is&nbsp;Stuart Weitzman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What have you learned about your personal style from wearing so many looks on TV?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because I dress up elegantly for work, the last thing I want to do is dress elegantly when I’m at home. Or even when I go out. Also, fabrics — taffeta doesn’t give, so I like more stretchy, comfortable fabrics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>You use your arms so much on the show. Do you have a pre-show arm workout?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes! I do. I work out at home. I spin and I do Pilates, and I also do 10-lb. weight arm exercises. I even have two 10-lb. weights at the studio, and usually, prior to the show I do 50 reps. My arms are bare and I want them to look good so it kind of pumps it up for the show. No one really knows that. [laughs]</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Do you wear <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Spanx</a>?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><span class=ql-cursor></span></strong>I do on some dresses, but I also sometimes wear pantyhose, when I wear short dresses, because I can’t stand body makeup.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtesy of Carol Kaelson</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What is your relationship with Pat like? He’s been your work husband for 35 years!</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He has, and we have the best relationship ever. We haven’t had one argument in 35 years. He’s easy to get along with. He’s funny. We’re good friends off-camera. He lives in Maryland, so I don’t see him that often, but I do see him when we are on location, or if he’s in LA for the show, we’ll go to dinner. I’m friends with his whole family. He knows my kids. I mean, 35 years! He definitely is my on-camera husband and it’s great!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What were your feelings about switching from the green, mechanical letters to the touch screens?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><span class=ql-cursor></span></strong>I often joke and say, “Is there any way you can make my job easier?” [laughs] It was to save time for the show. And, of course, it made my job easier too. I don’t make any mistakes because I won’t touch a letter unless it lights up.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Steve Crise</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_82-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Do you watch other game shows?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was a very big&nbsp;Jeopardy&nbsp;fan, and I watched&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune&nbsp;before I even got the part. I wrote in to be a contestant on the show. They wrote me back and said if you’re ever in LA, you can come by and audition. Little did I know…</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Is that how you got the job?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No, no! I went to a taping of&nbsp;Dance Fever, which was a show in the ‘80s, and my boyfriend was friends with one of the dancers —they had the same manager. So, we went to the show and he introduced me to a dancer on the show and I said to her, “Hey, can you introduce me to Merv [Griffin, creator of&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune]’s right-hand man? I hear they’re looking for a replacement on&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune.’ Because&nbsp;Dancer Fever&nbsp;was a Merv Griffin show too. I got an interview and auditioned, and I’m the one that got the job!</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Carol Kaelson</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>If you weren’t Vanna White, what would you be doing now?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I would probably be a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>real estate agent</a>. I love real estate — how they flip homes, I love that. I love watching HGTV:&nbsp;Flip or Flop,&nbsp;House Hunters,&nbsp;House Hunters International. I like the one with Chip and Joanna [Fixer&nbsp;Upper]. She does an amazing job decorating and the transformation of the homes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_95-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Do you ever do DIY home decorating yourself?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_97-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes!<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A few years ago, before it became so popular, I would buy mostly vacation places. I got a place in the desert and I fixed it up and sold it. It’s kind of a hobby. I did it a couple of times. I have a couple of vacation condos that are in different parts of the country, and I was thinking about flipping them, but instead, I decorated them for myself. I have a ski place and a beach place, and I rent them out. That’s a little side thing people don’t know about me. Nowadays, it’s hard to find a steal. Years ago? Oh man, they were everywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_99-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Is&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune&nbsp;a dream come true for teenage Vanna?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_101-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yes! I was a huge Barbie doll [girl]. I always dressed up my Barbie dolls. When I was 10 years old, I [decided] I wanted to be on TV. It wasn’t necessarily fashion; it was the dressing up. So that was a dream from the time I was 10, and look! Here I have this amazing job where I come to work, they dress me in beautiful clothes and do my hair and makeup, and that’s my job!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-favorite-looks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_105-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Favorite Looks</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_106-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1980s</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_107-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Courtesy Ron Slenzak.</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_108-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Ron Slenzak</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_109-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1990s</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_110-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Ron Slenzak</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_113-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Ron Slenzak</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_114-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Courtesy Steve Crise.</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_115-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2000s</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_116-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Carol Kaelson</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_119-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Carol Kaelson</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_120-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Steve Crise</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_123-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2010s</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_124-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Carol Kaelson</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_125-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy Carol Kaelson</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_126-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>2010s.
