My brother was born in 1975 and by 1978 my parents had split and we moved with her to this primitive hill farm, it was a real adventure.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Wild and free</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The view from the Black Mountains, where the farm is, to the Brecon Beacons is like something out of Africa, it is beautiful. In the summer it was paradise and in the winter we got properly snowed in. Although we had no money, there was extraordinary freedom and we read books. We became subsistence sheep farmers and it was healthy, wild and free.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/305af1a4-2ee0-48d2-96de-a939b318c3c7_15978172.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I went to a Welsh primary school and then got an assisted place – I’m one of Thatcher’s children – at private school, Malvern College. I was expelled from there aged 16. My responsibilities lifted as I got older – I was no longer my mother’s right-hand man, no longer a little husband to her and father to my brother – and a lot of that bottled up anxiety and trauma expressed itself in wild 20-something misbehaviour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I went to the University of York and studied English, I was good at it but I was lazy. I learned to make my way on the back of one or two really good teachers and on a childhood of reading.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Alcoholism, madness, divorce, death</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After York, I joined the Daily Mirror training scheme in Newcastle. As much as I admired the skills of tabloid journalism, I did not admire the ethics. At the end of that course I lived and worked for seven months in a London pub, the Chelsea Potter. That was my education in life, I learned more in those seven months than I did in the previous three years – it was like being the crew of a pirate ship on the King’s Road.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Golden boy: Hong Kong fencer Edgar Cheung on his road to Olympic glory</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I’d go across the road to the Waterstones (bookshop) and open a writer’s biography and see where they were at 25. They all promised the same thing – alcoholism, madness, divorce, death. None of that was off-putting to me, if anything it seemed to say, “You might be one of us.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Running for the hills</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I got a job as a researcher at the BBC in the radio arts unit. There were all these brilliant journalists in the same room every morning – Mohit Bakaya, Rob Ketteridge, Lawrence Pollard – it was a bear pit of brilliant brains and senses of humour working out what we were going to do that evening, I just loved it.</p>Working up from the bottom, I was there for about eight years and worked with some of the great writers and thinkers of our time – Seamus Heaney, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">David Lynch</span></a>, Douglas Coupland and Nadine Gordimer. It was an extraordinary time and place, but I kept thinking, I’m on the wrong side of the glass; I want to be doing what they are doing. I thought, if I don’t go now when I’ve got no partner, no children, no responsibilities, I’ll never go.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/8a572d71-d7d3-4b49-b34e-d5906ca3ea29_b70e8aef.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I got a publisher for my first book, Running for the Hills (2006), about growing up on a sheep farm in Wales, I resigned from the Beeb. I write to find out and what I found out was that the narrative that I had, that my mum had been abandoned by my dad, wasn’t actually true. If anything it was the other way around and my mum had fallen in love with the mountain and out of love with him.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">A single swallow</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I went to Sicily and edited an anthology of writers’ lives there, and then Running came out and it was a hit. Then I wrote a very poor book, in my opinion, called Truant: Notes from the Slippery Slope (2007) about drugs in the 1990s. I’ve had a recurring relationship with cannabis and if I’d taken the advice of that book, which was to stay away from it, I wouldn’t have been in the position I found myself in three years ago.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then I had an idea about swallows and decided to follow migrating swallows from South Africa back to Wales (resulting in the 2009 book A Single Swallow) – and that got me labelled as a travel writer, which is an honour, and that became my vocation.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Different kinds of love</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the end of the swallow journey I met my now ex-partner Rebecca and we moved to Rochdale [in northwest England], where she lived, and then to Verona, Italy, for five years and my son was born there in 2013. Rebecca’s son, her ex-husband and his new partner all moved out to the same block of flats as us, so we don’t do things in a very conventional way. In fact, I’m in the process of buying the house next door (in Yorkshire) to where Rebecca is going to live, so she and I are going to continue as partners in parenting and raising our little boy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/81ea7cee-e0bc-44e9-8cf7-7acd75a2b192_da992fda.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s very simple for children if they can see that adults love them and get on, we don’t have to be trapped in that ghastly old narrative of either happily ever after or miserable entrapment in a failing relationship or break-up. I don’t like any of that language. Ours is a recognition that there are different kinds of love and that sexual love can change or fail and that deep pragmatic love can endure.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Hope, strength and determination</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although in my books I explore harsh environments, like seafaring, or migrants or ice-breaking or more latterly in a mental hospital, what I tend to bring back is what I find there, which is hope, strength and determination. The thrust of my work tends to be optimistic and hopeful. I’ve won prizes for memoir, travel and children’s books, so I’ve got range. And those things matter because it can be an insecure profession and sometimes you wonder if you are any good at it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Three years ago I had a breakdown. I was writing for magazines and newspapers, was publishing two books, launching a course at Manchester University and trying to get back to the house in Yorkshire to do an impression of a decent father and partner, and the whole thing became too much. I was fuelling myself with light touches of cannabis and less light touches of whisky and went from hypomania – which is flights of ideas, optimism, incautious spending – to mania, which involves delusion, and then into psychosis, where I was wholly in another world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/c8891627-bb13-4012-830a-9b1fe71472ae_740f0b60.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Heavy light</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a long battle of me trying to stay free, and Rebecca trying to get me help, I was sectioned (committed compulsorily for mental health treatment) and taken to hospital in West Yorkshire for three weeks. After two doses of a very strong antipsychotic I was sane again, the people outside the window suddenly weren’t MI6, they were just builders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I figured as a writer it was an opportunity, so I started keeping a diary. When I came out I saw psychiatrists who were useless in that they didn’t ask me questions, they just told me I needed to be on medication for the rest of my life. So I went to psychotherapy, where an entire world was revealed, and worked on resolving the trauma that I’d suffered when my parents split up.</p>I did <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">EMDR</span></a> (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing), an amazing trauma therapy that unearthed what I call the dirty crystals of my past guilt and shame and I took them apart one by one. It’s no good just medicating away symptoms, what you need to do is address the causes and for that you need psychotherapy.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/11/05/697a0f18-12e7-4dfa-8fb2-649c2c622c49_1b233b46.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I changed my diet, my sleep patterns, my relationship with the truth and my willingness to say no to things when I’m beginning to push myself too hard, addressing fundamental things like perfectionism and a tendency to push myself to burnout.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I’ve been well for three years, in defiance of psychiatric science, and I wrote a book about it – Heavy Light (2021) – that involved a lengthy investigation into mental health. Every day I get a message from a reader saying that they, or someone close to them, are suffering and the system we have is not working for them, they’ve read the book and they know there are other systems out there that do work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As part of the Hong Kong International Literary Festival, Horatio Clare will give a talk on Heavy Light: A Journey Through Madness, Mania and Healing on Thursday November 11 at Asia Society, 9 Justice Drive, Admiralty, 8.30pm to 9.30pm.
