In fact, they find humor in the constant whisperings about their marital life.</p><p>Marjorie and the Family Feud host have played into the gossip with a hilarious <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram video</a> addressing the claims. But whether you believe reports about <a href=#>Steve Harvey and his wife</a> splitting up, Marjorie says that couldn’t be farther from the truth.&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We’re best friends</a>,” she told People.&nbsp;“It’s the first time either of us has had someone we can talk to about everything.”&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Here, we find out more about Marjorie Harvey, including how she and Steve met, her secrets to living life to the fullest and rising above the gossip.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Marjorie Harvey’s background?</h2><p>Born Marjorie Bridges on October 10, 1964, Marjorie grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. After enrolling in the University of Memphis, Marjorie realized that a college degree would not contribute to her career goals, and she dropped out to pursue her passion for fashion and travel. She attended fashion shows from Hollywood to Paris to New York and back again, garnering all the experience she could.&nbsp;</p><p>Her lifelong passion eventually turned blossomed into a business and she became a social media influencer. Today, she has more than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">3 million followers on Instagram</a> alone.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Marjorie Harvey meet Steve?</h2><p>Marjorie first saw and met Steve at a comedy club in Memphis, Tennessee, while Steve was performing his stand-up routine there back in 1990.&nbsp;“I was late, and I thought he was gonna give me the business because he got real quiet,” Marjorie told the audience on The Steve Harvey Show about their first meeting.&nbsp; “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">He was just staring at me</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, Steve actually stopped the show and just continued staring.&nbsp;“I thought I was going to become part of the show.&nbsp;He finally realized, ‘Oh, I gotta say something.’&nbsp; He was, like, ‘Oh I’m sorry.&nbsp;I don’t know who this is, but I’m gonna marry her.’”</p><p>But love at first sight did not translate into an immediate courtship and ensuing marriage.&nbsp; Marjorie and Steve went their separate ways after just a few weeks of dating.&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I knew he was the one shortly after I started dating him, but then he just left</a>.&nbsp;Disappeared,” Marjorie told Essence.&nbsp; Harvey explained later that he just wasn’t ready for a committed relationship at that time and he wanted to settle his career and finances.&nbsp;</p><p>It took a decade before Marjorie laid eyes on Steve again and the two reconnected. As fate would have it, Steve was fresh off his sitcom The Steve Harvey Show, and finding himself single again when&nbsp;Steve’s bodyguard actually suggested a reunion with Marjorie.&nbsp;</p><p>“When Steve came back into my life, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it was effortless</a>,” she said to People. After two years of dating, the two were married on June 25, 2007.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/shutterstock_editorial_1177458a.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marjorie Harvey stands by her man</h2><p>During Steve Harvey’s hosting of Miss Universe in 2015, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accidentally announced Miss Columbia as the winner</a> when in fact, it was Miss Philippines who would wear the coveted title and tiara.&nbsp;Steve profusely apologized, saying it was an honest mistake as he misread his cue card when announcing the winner, but he came under major fire for the gaffe.</p><p>Marjorie was quick to stand by her man and offered him support.&nbsp; “You are a Stand Up Man and A True Class Act the way you went back out on the stage on live TV and took full responsibility alone,” she wrote on Instagram.&nbsp; “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I am so proud to be your wife.&nbsp;I love you</a>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Marjorie Harvey (@marjorie_harvey)</a></p></figure><p>Over the years, Steve has been equally as expressive of his love and admiration for his wife.

That being said, the Harvey household became a busy one, with the couple sharing seven children among themselves.&nbsp;And blending their families wasn’t smooth sailing in the beginning, as their kids were a bit hesitant.</p><p>“But we knew this was right.&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We’re mom and dad to everybody now</a>,” Marjorie told People in 2016.&nbsp; “I wish every woman can find a soulmate like I’ve been blessed to find. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This is really my best friend</a>,” she told Essence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Screenshot-2023-07-24-at-1.03.58-PM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marjorie Harvey’s passion for fashion</h2><p>Marjorie has made a career out of her love for fashion, and has even helped Steve to up his game.&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve been passionate about fashion all my life</a>,” she told Steve during an appearance on his talk show.&nbsp;“We both love fashion so that’s one of the things we have in common.”&nbsp;In fact, she often posts couples outfits of them stepping out of their home on her instagram page.</p><p>Her input on how both she and Steve present themselves to the world doesn’t end with clothing and accessories.&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marjorie told Steve to keep his graying beard and mustache instead of dying it black again</a>, he shared on The Ellen Show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Screenshot-2023-07-24-at-9.34.24-AM.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Steve and Marjorie Harvey Foundation</h2><p>Marjorie also help found <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Steve and Marjorie Harvey Foundation</a> that was conceived to help under-resourced communities receive the tools for success.&nbsp; According to their site, “The Steve & Marjorie Harvey Foundation (SMHF) provides youth outreach services that help cultivate the next generation of responsible leaders by providing mentoring, educational enrichment, mental wellness support, life transformation skills, and global service initiatives.”</p><p>One important platform under the foundation is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marjorie Harvey’s Girls Who Rule The World</a>.&nbsp; The agenda is to help young girls develop positive self-esteem and succeed in their education through mentoring and other resources.&nbsp; Marjorie lends more than just her name to this program.&nbsp; She takes an active role and has hosted a meet-up, bestowed a scholarship on a student and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marjorie Harvey is also a caretaker</h2><p>The other main man in Marjorie’s life is her dad, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s and Alzheimers in 2019.&nbsp;And the prospect of losing him has proven to be the hardest challenge she’s faced yet.</p><p>“I literally watched my grandmother sit in the bed and whittle away, ending up in the fetal<br>position,” Marjorie recalls in a 2021 interview with Preserving Your Memory. “My whole thing was, OK, what have we learned from that and what can we do?
