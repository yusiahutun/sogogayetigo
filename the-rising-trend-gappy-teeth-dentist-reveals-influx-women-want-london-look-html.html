often appears between the two upper front teeth. However, gaps can occur between any two teeth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A common cause is a mismatch between the size of the jaw bones and the size of the teeth, which spread the teeth out further. The opposite of overcrowding can also occur.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It can also be because the teeth alone are very narrow, or there are missing teeth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Thumb sucking can force the teeth forward and create a gap, as well as a habit called tongue thrust.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tongue thrust is when a person pushes their tongue forward rather than to the roof of their mouth when they swallow, which over time creates a gap.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some studies suggest five per cent of people have tongue thrust, and although it can be stopped with training as a child, it's not usually possible in adulthood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/health/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Hughes said many women are coming to his surgery with a gap the width of a pound coin who want it reduced to the width of a penny.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are various methods to achieve it, depending on the natural cause of their spaced-apart teeth.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Invisalign, which are removable and barely noticeable retainers, will straighten the teeth and position them to a specific place using digital planning.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You can design the movement of teeth to take the gap from 2mm to 1mm,' Dr Hughes said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Composite bonding, a type of cosmetic material like fake enamel, and veneers, used to smooth out texture and create a desired shape, are more traditional methods for making the teeth wider.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Almost half of the women Dr Hughes sees are those who regret drastic measures to close their gaps in the past.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'I see an awful lot of gaps closed badly that we fix.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I had a patient who had previously closed her gap using composite bonding but it made her teeth appear really wide so aesthetically it was worse. She should have had her teeth moved together first.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If the gap is&nbsp;too big it looks cumbersome and is considered ugly, but the changes need to be subtle.'</p><img id=i-e698996537d0617a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/12/15/15968822-7240505-image-a-40_1562943437827.jpg height=897 width=634 alt="Predominately women in their 20s are following the trend, but women in their 30s and 40s are paying to reverse dentistry work that filled their gap before, Dr Hughes said.
