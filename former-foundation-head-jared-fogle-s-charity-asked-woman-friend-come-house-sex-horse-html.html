class=mol-para-with-font><span>Following Taylor's arrest, the Jared Foundation cut all ties with the former executive director and Fogle issued a statement saying he was 'shocked' by the allegations.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Taylor was formally charged in court on May 4 with seven counts of producing child pornography and one count of possessing child pornography, and ordered held at the Marion County jail.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He attempted suicide while behind bars on May 6, but survived and was rushed to an Indianapolis area hospital to

home on July 7.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Fogle's team pointed out the fact that he has not yet been arrested, saying that if the FBI had reason to detain the Subway spokesman he

It goes deeper than that.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>As for why she came forward, she said; 'It was the right thing to do, and I was able to do it and I have fortitude to do it.
