This is the only way any new parent would enjoy the freedom and benefits of having adopted a child. Illegal adoption will cause trauma to the child especially when it is discovered. It is important therefore to understand that adoption is the legal assumption of all responsibilities of raising a child that may not necessarily be naturally yours in the sense that the child is not your own biologically. Child adoption in Kenya may be a bit strict than it is in other countries in Africa but it is better today than it was a few years back.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f64df660b27019b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a tour company successfully in Kenya</span></p></a><h2>What are the requirements for adopting a child?</h2><p class=align-left>Inasmuch as it has been said that <a href=# title="adoption process" rel="nofollow noopener">adopting a child</a> is pretty simple, you need to know what to do. Sticking to the rules makes the entire process enjoyable. The following are things you must know about the adoption process in Kenya.</p><ul><li>To adopt a child, you first need to start by finding a registered adoption society. This is the entity that will hold your hand through both legal and social requirements. It is the mandate of this society to walk with you from the beginning to the end of the adoption process.</li><li>Make inquires about your interest in adoption. It is at this point that you will be introduced to the laws of adoption in Kenya. For instance, you are allowed to adopt a child if you are 25 years of age and above. In addition, you need to be 21 or more years older than the child you want to adopt. Unless under special occasion, single ladies can only adopt girls and single men can adopt only boys.</li><li>Bring with you your national ID, a certificate of good conduct and a referral letter from a religious leader.</li><li>Be ready to spend about Ksh 8000 to Ksh 12000 depending on the adoption society you need.</li><li>Home assessment will then follow, after which your case will go before a committee which scrutinizes your application. More often than not, this is just a formality and your request will most likely go through.</li><li>The next step would be for you to identify a child but you should know that the adoption society will find you a child that resembles to you.</li><li>After your child is identified, you will need 2 weeks to bond after which you will go home with your child and be under observation for 3 months of placement.</li><li><a href=# title="adoption process" rel="nofollow noopener">Married couples</a> that want to adopt a child must have been married for at least 3 years</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0d606f54d00c9614.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to become a pilot in Kenya: Requirements, schools, fees, salary</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Unlike what many people think, you do not necessarily need a lawyer at the beginning of the process. In fact, you can do without one since courts encourage self representation as they have become a lot friendlier. Depending on what you decide to do, the process can take a minimum of 6 months. The secret is to find one of the good adoption agencies in Kenya and work with them. This is your best chance of having a smooth adoption process.</p><p class=align-left>Now that we have understood the process, it is important to know about who can adopt a child and which child can be adopted as well. Adoptions in Kenya can happen in so many ways. To adopt a child as a married couple, both of you must be in agreement and must have been married for not less than 3 years. It is also possible for one parent to adopt the other parent's child as long as it is with the consent of the biological parent. It is also possible for kinship adoption to take place. This is where a relative adopts a child as his own. For all adoptions to take place, both the adoptive child and parent must be residents of Kenya for the 6 months period the adoption is to take place.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e182f2ceff3ff22c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to write a petition letter (with samples)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Now that we have understood about the adoptive parent, it helps to know how the adoptive child should be like. First the child must be 18 years and below. He or should must also be living in Kenya. Adoption of this child can take place if the child was found abandoned such that the whereabouts of the parents are unknown. The child is orphaned and relatives or guardians are unwilling to take care of him or her. A child can also be adopted if the parents have offered consent for the adoption. Sometimes parents offer their children for adoption for one reason or another. If you are a foreigner looking to adopt a child then consider coming to stay in Kenya for 6 months first as already mentioned in the requirements above.</p><h3>How much does it cost to adopt from Kenya?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3f64df660b27019b.jpg><p class=align-left>The cost of adopting a child varies greatly depending on a number of things. First, the adoption society you choose has a charge for facilitating the process. This cost varies from one place to another. Secondly, the charges will also depend on whether or not you represent yourself in court or you use a lawyer. In case you decide to go with a lawyer then he costs will definitely be higher as you must cover the lawyer's fee. The standard fee for most agencies is however <a href=# title="adoption process" rel="nofollow noopener">ksh. 12,500</a>. Add lawyer's charges if you will use one as this is based on your negotiations with the lawyer. In most cases, families have been approved for adoption even with low income which goes to show that adoption in Kenya is not about money.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54c257078ed60f4f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to tell if your baby mama still loves you</span></p></a><h3>List of adoption societies in Kenya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0d606f54d00c9614.jpg><p class=align-left>It is clear that the best and easiest way to adopt a child in Kenya is through the use of an <a id="https://www.google.com/search?q=adoption+societies+in+kenya&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0" href=# title="adoption process" rel="nofollow noopener">adoption society.</a> These include:</p><ul><li>Little Angels network</li><li>KKPI adoption society</li><li>Child welfare society of Kenya</li></ul><h3>Adoption laws in Kenya</h3><p class=align-left>A lot can be said about adoption in Kenya but it will not hold water if it is not in agreement with the law. Adoption is provided by law under the Children Act No 8 of 2001, under part XII. In addition to this, the Children Adoption Regulations 2005 also provides a guideline for the process. According to this regulations and the law, the welfare and safety of the child is paramount. The laws are focused on making the adoption process transparent, friendly and accessible. The law also stipulates the government's role in the whole adoption process.

It is also possible to withhold consent if spouses are permanently separated.</p><p class=align-left>The law also has stipulations in which certain people are barred from adopting children in Kenya. These include:</p><ul><li>Individual of unsound mind</li><li>People that have been previously convicted or charged with child molestation offenses</li><li>Homosexuals</li><li>Joint applicants that are not married to each other</li><li>A male foreigner that is a sole applicant</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs26odu1bnscng.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Types of marriages in Kenya recognized by law</span></p></a><h3>How long does it take to go through the adoption process?</h3><p class=align-left>As already mentioned earlier, the minimum time the process can take is 6 months. This is the fastest it can be since the adoption process has been made easier and more convenient for people in Kenya. However, if you choose to drag the process then it can take years to complete.
