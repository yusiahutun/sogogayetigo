For those with bipolar disorder, mood episodes and side effects can magnify body image issues. <a href=#>Bipolar disorder</a> is a mental health illness that causes significant mood and energy fluctuations. You may alternate between “up” energy states ranging from agitation to euphoria (mania or hypomania) and “down” low-energy states (<a href=#>depression</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>However, <a href=#>bipolar illness impacts more than just the psyche. It can also transform your physique. Nearly 70% of those seeking treatment for bipolar illness are overweight or obese.</a> Many drugs that are used to treat bipolar illness cause weight gain. Other characteristics associated with bipolar disease, such as depression and drug abuse, can also contribute to excessive eating and weight gain. Managing the emotional highs and lows of bipolar disease is critical, as is keeping a healthy body weight.</p><p>According to a 2017 study, excessive weight can create health difficulties and may also disrupt brain chemistry in ways that could make bipolar illness worse.&nbsp;Furthermore, it may have a detrimental impact on body image, or a person’s perception of their physical appearance. Symptoms of bipolar disorder (BD) and potential weight gain from treatment can significantly impact body image. For example, if you see a significant change in your body size after commencing therapy, it may affect how you feel about or view your body. Obesity is associated with increased body dissatisfaction, worse <a href=#>self-esteem</a>, and higher incidences of depression.</p><p>As a result, it does nothing to alleviate the symptoms of bipolar illness. Body dissatisfaction is a primary cause of <a href=#>eating disorders</a>, and many BD patients suffer from an eating disorder. As Watson highlighted in her piece, Eating problems can appear extremely differently among persons with bipolar illness. Mania and sadness can worsen the symptoms of eating disorders, leading to either restricted diets or overeating. <a href=#>Binge eating disorder</a> and bulimia may coexist more frequently with bipolar illness than <a href=#>anorexia nervosa</a>. An eating problem may certainly complicate BD management and should be addressed as part of a multifaceted therapy strategy.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Can bipolar illness lead to disordered eating?</h3><p><a href=#>One-third of persons</a> with bipolar disorder also have an eating issue. Despite their prevalence, eating problems can seem extremely different in people with bipolar illness. Mania and sadness can intensify the symptoms of eating disorders, leading to restricted diets or overeating. Binge eating disorder and bulimia are more commonly associated with bipolar disorder than anorexia nervosa.</p><p>Some instances of how bipolar illness may lead to disordered eating include&nbsp;</p><ul><li>During depressive episodes, some people may either overeat or undereat as a way to cope with intense feelings of <a href=#>sadness</a> and stress.</li><li>Unfocused thoughts and a lack of preparation during manic episodes may make it difficult for someone to concentrate on eating.</li><li>&nbsp;On the other side, mania might cause an increase in hunger and less worry about body image concerns.</li><li>People with bipolar illness may use alcohol or other drugs that impair their appetite.</li><li>Some patients may forego treatment for bipolar illness due to concerns about weight gain as a side effect of the drugs.&nbsp;</li><li>People may also engage in undesirable behaviours to avoid weight gain, such as restricted eating or purging.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Will therapy help with body image issues?</h3><p>Treatment is vital for controlling bipolar disease, but body image concerns can exacerbate matters. For some patients, weight gain caused by certain therapies may exacerbate body image difficulties. A person’s body image may be unfavourable even before they begin treatment for bipolar illness, making it difficult for them to keep to their treatment plans.</p><p>According to a 2021 study, people who already have body image concerns may be less inclined to take their medicine because they are concerned about the possibility of weight gain as a side effect. People who stop taking bipolar illness medications are more likely to require hospitalization or commit suicide.</p><p>Not everyone had the same experience, however. For some people, therapy can help them lessen the impact of <a href=#>mood swings</a> and improve their body image concerns, which are connected to their symptoms. A mental health expert can assist you in understanding and dealing with bipolar illness symptoms, your connection with your body, and the overlap between the two.</p><p><strong>Related : <a href=#>8 Ways to Deal with Body Image Issues</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What therapies can be used?</h4><p>Bipolar illnesses and body image problems respond best to a combination of medication and treatment. Both cognitive behavioural therapies are successful. These therapies help people understand the basic ideas that drive their thinking and then relate them to their behaviours. <a href=#>Dialectical Behavior Therapy</a> (DBT) is a sort of cognitive therapy that is especially beneficial for those suffering from body image issues and bipolar illnesses since it focuses on learning to control emotional states and endure uncomfortable feelings.</p><p>Therapy, regardless of theoretical orientation, helps individuals to become more aware of their triggers, feelings, and actions, which can encourage mindfulness and intentionality in their decisions while also increasing self-accountability.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Managing Bipolar and body image issues Together</h4><p>Unfortunately, bipolar illnesses and body image issues frequently go untreated or are misdiagnosed. According to a research, “consumers with bipolar disorder face up to ten years of coping with symptoms before getting a correct diagnosis, with only one in four receiving an accurate diagnosis in less than three years.” Early identification is critical in treating both body image disorders and bipolar illnesses since the longer symptoms are endured, the more damaged an individual’s life becomes.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Relapse Prevention and Aftercare Support</h4><p>Due to the unpredictable nature of bipolar diseases, many people with eating disorders and co-occurring bipolar disorders face the risk of relapse.</p><p>Maintaining an effective and helpful treatment team is a critical component of relapse prevention for people suffering from both diseases. This might imply while in treatment, but it should also include the outpatient team. Individuals living with these diseases should be aware of their services and support so that they may seek assistance if they experience lapses or impulses.</p><p>Another key aspect of relapse prevention for people suffering from bipolar illness and eating disorders is medication consistency. This might imply while in treatment, but it should also include the outpatient team. Individuals living with these diseases should be aware of their services and support so that they may seek assistance if they experience lapses or impulses.</p><p>Another key aspect of relapse prevention for people suffering from bipolar illness and eating disorders is medication consistency. It may not be ideal to take medicine every day, but it has been proven to be a beneficial practice in helping persons with bipolar illnesses to live full lives unaffected by their symptoms.</p><p>It is enough to cope with one terrible mental condition, let alone two. Individuals who have been diagnosed with both bipolar illness and an eating disorder should try to embrace their diseases. This acceptance will help them to deal with the implications for their everyday life. It is possible to obtain good <a href=#>therapy</a> for both diseases while living satisfying lives; however, ongoing proactivity and participation in therapies are essential.</p>References +<ul><li>Tully, A., Murphy, E., Smyth, S., Conway, Y., Geddes, J., Devane, D., Kelly, J., & Jordan, F.
