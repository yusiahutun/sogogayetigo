We want none of that to change for anybody.”</p><p>Gerry and Theresa also explained that, while it was always their “plan” to make their marriage work, they couldn’t find a solution on where to live given that their families were in different states. “We looked at homes in South Carolina, we considered New Jersey, and we just looked at homes after home, but we never got to the point where we made that decision,” Theresa said. The couple also confirmed that they still love each other despite their failed marriage. “I still love this person,” Gerry said. “There’s no doubt in my mind, I still am in love with her. I root for her every day.” Theresa added, “Yeah, I still love him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-golden-bachelor-cast-s-reactions-to-gerry-and-theresa-s-divorce>The Golden Bachelor cast’s reactions to Gerry and Theresa’s divorce.</h2><p>Since the news of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1746729/gerry-theresa-break-up-golden-bachelor/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Gerry and Theresa’s divorce</a>, many Golden Bachelor cast members like Susan Noles, Kathy Swarts, and Faith Martin have reacted to the news.

She continued, “I’ve had a lot of love in my life, real love. She can do it again, and she can do it better.

That’s why it’s such a serious thing. You got to ask the right questions to see if things could really, really work, and perhaps they just did not have enough time for that.”</p><p>Though she didn’t win Gerry’s season, Faith still had empathy for him and Theresa. “I wish them both all the happiness in the world, and I’m sure this was a traumatic thing to go through for both of them, so my heart goes out to them,” she said. “I’m sure everything will really be okay in the long run, and someday they’ll look back and just smile, hopefully.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.4726720647773><h2>April Kirkwood</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/April-The-Golden-Bachelor.jpg><p>April Kirkwood, who went home in Week 4 on The Golden Bachelor, shaded Gerry and Theresa in an <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5q7yoMx1gx/?hl=en" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> video. “POV watching drama you’re not involved in unfold around you,” she wrote on a video of her smiling and twirling in a garden.
