Charlie's story began on 28 January 2015 when his mother made a 911 call, desperately seeking help.</p><p class=align-left>She told the dispatcher that her husband <a href=#>tried to kill</a> her by choking her. But her husband downplayed the incident and called his wife childish. Nevertheless, a deputy visited the homestead as it was the norm for the 18 calls made from the residence between 2003 and 2015.</p><p class=align-left>The wife refused to have her husband arrested. On 5 February 2015, Charlie Tan had one of his friends purchase a gun on his behalf. At 10:00 pm that night, Charlie told one of his friends he was leaving the country. However, another concerned friend who had interacted with Charlie noticed something wrong with him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9949585ea163efd1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Adam Perkins' cause of death explained: What really happened</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The friend called the police, who arrived at Charlie's home. Although the police talked to a calm Charlie for ten minutes, he never spoke to his father. On 6 February, prosecutors believe that Charlie Tan and his mother travelled to Canada intending to flee to China eventually. However, they changed their mind and returned home.</p><p class=align-left>On 9 February 2015, Charlie's mother called 911 to report that Charlie had shot his father trying to protect her. She also told the dispatcher that her husband tried to torture her. But as Charlie's trial continued, it became evident that the call was fake and that Jim may have died four days earlier.</p><p class=align-left>Four days later, a grand jury indicted Charlie. Charlie Tan's case started on 14 September 2015 and ended on 8 October.
