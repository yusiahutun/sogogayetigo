Every year on Teresa's birthday, Wilson sprays "Scandalous," a discontinued Victoria's Secret body spray that was Teresa's favorite. "It just makes me feel close to her and that she's really not that far away. It's comforting to access her memory that way," says Wilson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I can relate. Since my mother died of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ALS</a> 12 years ago and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>my father from cancer</a> eight years ago, I love to keep their belongings close. I still cherish my mother's diamond earrings for a special occasion, her brown fake Gucci purse, my father's sweat stained tennis T-shirt, and his 11-year-old green Jeep that I inherited. (Because of my connection to my dad through the Jeep, I immediately empathized with Minnie Driver's character's love for her late husband's car in this Modern Love <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>episode</a> adapted from the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>New York Times column</a>.) My parents missed most major events in my adult years — my wedding, buying my first house, and the birth of my daughters. Keeping their belongings close does not bring them back, but it has made those moments feel a little less lonely without them.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When someone dies, items that they used can become an important source of connection and comfort for their loved ones. "[These items] are important because they provide a sense of security. They are symbolic connections. It's a tangible way of being connected and feeling closer to the person you lost — and, in all honesty, helping us transition to living without them," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cara Mearns-Thompson</a>, a licensed clinical social worker focused on grief and co-founder of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Grief Club of Minnesota</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some experts refer to these objects as "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>transitional objects of grief.</a>" In 1951, Donald Winnicott proposed that "transitional objects," like a stuffed animal or blanket, helped young children navigate separation from their caretaker. Similarly, objects chosen after a loved one has died can support a bereaved individual transition through the separation of death. These objects, which other experts refer to as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>"linking objects"</a> are a physical reminder for a grieving person of a loved one who died. According to grief experts, these items are common among grievers. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Almost all of 294 bereaved mothers</a> in one study who lost their children to Sudden Infant Syndrome (SIDS) reported that they had a transitional object of grief, such as their child's blanket or favorite toy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you start looking, you can find examples of them everywhere in pop culture, too. Nadia's dead mother's necklace in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Russian Doll</a>, Devi's father's motorbike in Never Have I Ever and some food items in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Bear</a> (which I won't share for fear of giving away the ending) are just a few.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's instinctual to reach for linking objects after a person precious to us dies. We miss someone, so we reach for the closest alternative," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Alan Wolfelt</a>, Ph.D., a grief counselor, author and founder of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Center for Loss and Life Transition</a>,says. "In addition to missing their body, their face, their smile, we miss their voice, their laughter, their scent, their touch. Linking objects are tangible, so they connect us through touch and often smell as well as sight."</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>alan wolfelt, ph.d., grief counselor</h3><p>"It's instinctual to reach for linking objects after a person precious to us dies. We miss someone, so we reach for the closest alternative.

According to Mearns-Thompson, it's natural to fear that our loved ones will be forgotten after they die, and these selected objects often serve as reminders of their life to assuage that worry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you think about transitional objects you can think about us carrying them with us both literally and figuratively. And that healthy grief is creating a new relationship with the deceased which can happen through these transitional objects as well as sustaining a loving connection with that person who died," says Mearns-Thompson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These momentos can also serve as a narrative prompt according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Robert Neimeyer,</a> Ph.D., the director of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Portland Institute for Loss and Transition</a> and professor of psychology at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>University of Memphis</a>. "They provide the opportunity to speak the loved ones' name, to tell a bit of their story once more," he said. "When we share a story about another, we invite them back into life. We renew their membership in the club of life. We 'remember' them in this way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's another reason why Madaio loves wearing her dad's clothes. "It's always a little special for me when someone compliments me on something I'm wearing, and I get to say 'Thank you! It's my Dad's.' Maybe, subconsciously, I hope people do ask," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some may feel less inclined to touch or use these objects as time passes, which can be a sign of healing and reconciliation, according to Wolfelt. Depending on the person, object, and relationship with the deceased, some may continue to use or wear their objects frequently, even decades later. I go through different phases where I cling to one object of my parents more, but I always feel better with one of their belongings close by. As I write this I'm sitting at my father's desk and feel encouraged by him in some small way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't see any problem in people wearing their mother's engagement ring or something for the rest of their lives or having a special broach that represents their grandmother or keeping their dad's carved decoy on the library shelf," says Neimeyer. "These are perfectly normal, touching, interesting ways that we remind ourselves and others that our lives had significance because of these relationships. We carry these people forward in our lives."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are some objects, like my dad's car, which unfortunately can't be held onto forever. Parting with one of these objects can be difficult, but, as Mearns-Thompson helps remind me, the memories associated with the object can't ever be taken away. And of course, grief objects are just one of many coping mechanisms you can turn to, she says. Other ways to hold space for a loved one who has died include honoring the person on a special holiday or with memorial markers, such as trees, supporting causes associated with that person's death, and enjoying activities you both shared together, such as music or food.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Understanding the special power of these objects, D'Anna recently parted with the gold wedding band that brought her so much peace after her mom died. Before getting married last year, she had the band re-polished and engraved with "Dawn's Girl" (their mother's name) and gave it to her little sister as a maid of honor gift, she says. "She's the only person I'd stop wearing it for."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Grief is hard. When I reflect on my mom's passing, I realize I'm not as okay as I usually think I am. Nothing prepares you for this feeling, or how to cope afterwards," she continues. "But for those of us who are lucky enough to have items of loved ones that have passed on, it's something to keep us connected. For that I'm grateful."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9OrmKermam2sLrApWSompqasLW%2FjKCpop2W</p></div><div id=links><a href=./south-carolina-morgan-island-monkeys-animal-testing-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;The mysterious island in South Carolina which is off limits to visitors but home to 4,000 WILD MONKE</a>
