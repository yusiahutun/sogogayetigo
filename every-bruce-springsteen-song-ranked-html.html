data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxawgi5l00353h65f63n25er@published data-word-count=104>In 1974, a random phrase popped into Bruce Springsteen’s head as he was writing, one that seemed to match the music he was hearing in his mind. It took Springsteen six months to turn that phrase, “Born to Run,” into a song, and it was a watershed moment for his work: the first time he wrote a song with the studio in mind rather than how it would sound onstage. That’s when he finally figured out how to combine the crackle and power of the epic songs he wrote with the skill of compression, distilling the energy into a brisk 4:31 without losing impact.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-2-0-1@published data-word-count=138>Figuring out how to make “Born to Run” work affected Springsteen’s songwriting process not only for the rest of the album of the same name, but for the rest of his career. The themes and characters he established on that song formed the basis of his work and persona, and for the past 43 years he’s continued to write about love, faith, hope, struggle, meaning, and identity. He has explored the dark side of the American dream, broken promises, and the possibilities of salvation and redemption. Just as important, he’s exalted the “the majesty, the mystery, the ministry&nbsp;— of rock and roll!” as he used to declare onstage, capturing the heat and joy of a busy dance floor on a Saturday night, and his wholehearted belief in rock music as nothing less than a genuine force of liberation.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-2-0-2@published data-word-count=173>While on tour in 2015, Springsteen would describe his first four albums as “outsider records.”&nbsp;<a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id>Greetings From Asbury Park</a> and <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id>The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle</a>, from 1973,&nbsp;were full of tales of Jersey Shore legends and had strong moments, but were musically and lyrically unfocused, the work of a young songwriter trying to find his voice. Yet just two years later, when he produced 1975’s <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id>Born to Run</a> — and later, 1978’s <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id>Darkness on the Edge of Town</a> — Springsteen knew who and what he wanted to write about. On those records, the characters were yearning for escape, looking for a way out, trying to make sense of their lives. Then, of course, there’s <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id>Born in the U.S.A</a>., 1984’s million-selling, seven top-ten-hits album that turned Springsteen into an international superstar. He’s referred to the record’s “grab-bag” nature in the past, but there’s more thematic unity than appears on first glance, and the record still holds true to many of his core motifs: loyalty, faith, and songs that will get people dancing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-2-0-3@published data-word-count=120>This list was published for the first time in 2016 and was revisited in 2019 for the addition of Western Stars. At that time, Bruce was already promising that we’d see a new E Street Band album soon, and the Boss has delivered with 2020’s Letter to You. So, once again, the new material from that record (along with the release of a song on a film soundtrack) has been incorporated into the list. (In the recent Letter to You documentary on Apple TV+, there’s a scene where Bruce toasts his band and declares, “We’re taking this thing till we’re all in a box.” It is my absolute delight to remain in service to update this list for the duration.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-2-0-4@published data-word-count=184>Wrestling the entirety of his catalogue into a rank is a monumental task — this is a man who readily admits he has sometimes worked hardest on songs that didn’t make his records. With that in mind, all of the commercially available material was given equal consideration, whether catalogue classic, outtake, or recently released composition. The ground rules: This list consists of all original, officially released Bruce Springsteen compositions, whether an official album track or an outtake. That includes Tracks, The Promise, and The Ties That Bind box sets, but excludes all covers (even those strongly associated with Springsteen, as well as The Seeger Sessions.) The pre-record contract demos on Chapter & Verse and the CD accompanying Springsteen’s biography Born to Run also fall outside the purview of this list. Where multiple versions of a song exist, they’re addressed within the same listing when relevant. With 2020’s introduction of Letter to You, along with a newly released song on the Blinded by the Light soundtrack, this leaves us with an updated total of 340 officially released Bruce Springsteen songs to discuss. Here we go.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-3-0-0@published data-word-count=54><strong>340. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Mr. Outside,” The Ties That Bind</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Two minutes and sixteen seconds of a half-formed thought that was probably recorded in the corner of Springsteen’s Telegraph Hill bedroom. I say “probably” because there were no notes provided or context given. Why was this throwaway included in a deluxe box set? Why was this even released?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-4-0-0@published data-word-count=21><strong>339. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Mary Queen of Arkansas,” Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</strong></a>&nbsp;This is a terrible song. The music is maudlin, the lyrics overwritten.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-5-0-0@published data-word-count=74><strong>338. </strong><a href=#><strong>“The Angel,” Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</strong></a> How are “The Angel” and “Mary Queen of Arkansas” on the same record? This song’s only saving grace is the introduction of the phrase “hubcap heaven” into the vernacular. If you wipe the dust off that inscription over there, you’ll see that “the interstate’s choked with nomadic hordes” was the first public outing of a line Springsteen would put to much better&nbsp;use in “Born to Run.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-6-0-0@published data-word-count=72><strong>337. </strong><a href=#><strong>“This Is Your Sword,” High Hopes</strong></a><strong>.</strong> More like “This Is Your Cliché.” Don’t get me wrong, I want Springsteen&nbsp;to release as much original music as possible for as long as he wants to make it, but High Hopes feels so haphazard because of songs like this. It’s an attempt to make something out of nothing. The music is saccharine and there’s a tremulous quality to the vocals, which don’t add anything.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-7-0-0@published data-word-count=58><strong>336. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Bishop Danced,” Tracks</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Early songs aren’t automatically assigned holy status. “Bishop Danced” is definitely interesting as an artifact —&nbsp;it was recorded live at Max’s Kansas City in 1973, probably as a publishing demo —&nbsp;but it’s a mess. This song makes no sense, even in the most impressionistic, symbolic interpretation of its lyrics, and the melody is bland.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-8-0-0@published data-word-count=39><strong>335. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Zero and Blind Terry,” Tracks</strong></a><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Again, just because a song is old doesn’t mean that it deserves worship. This was Springsteen’s first attempt at writing a large romantic epic, and there’s a good reason why it was an outtake.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-9-0-0@published data-word-count=106><strong>334. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Red Headed Woman,” MTV Plugged</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This number was introduced on the Joad tour as, and I quote, “A great song about a great subject: cunnilingus.” Although I absolutely applaud the sentiment from a feminist standpoint, I can’t applaud the actual song because it’s cheap, cloying, and simply not good. Springsteen has several jokey songs that get played live for a brief period of time, but never get recorded because sanity prevails. Among these are “Pilgrim in the Temple of Love” (about Santa Claus at a strip club) and “Sell It and They Will Come” (about the advent of home-shopping channels). That’s where this song belongs.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-10-0-0@published data-word-count=59><strong>333. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Hunter of Invisible Game,” High Hopes</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Lyrically, this one starts out promisingly —&nbsp;I want to know why he built an ark of gopher wood —&nbsp;but then Bruce mentions railroad tracks, so it’s clearly not biblical. It’s an interesting idea that feels complete, but isn’t. Not the worst offender on this grab bag of an album, but it’s close.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-11-0-0@published data-word-count=252><strong>332. </strong><a href=#><strong>“American Land,” Wrecking Ball</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Springsteen began performing this song toward the end of his 2006 Seeger Sessions tour, and announced that it was “an original Springsteen song inspired by ‘He Lies in the American Land,’ a poem by immigrant steelworker Andrew Kovaly, and set to music by Pete Seeger.” (Kovaly wrote “He Lies in the American Land” in Slovakian, his native language, and Pete Seeger wrote an English version of the song.) Seeger’s song is<a href=#> an amazing, atonal dirge</a>, and the story is heartrending: A new immigrant comes to America, works in the mines, makes enough money to send for his family to join him,&nbsp;but dies before they arrive. As originally written, “American Land” would fit comfortably alongside many of the songs on Tom Joad. It is direct, dark, and very bleak. As transformed by Springsteen, the song bears no resemblance to the original in voice, tone, or intention. The music is Pogues lite. (Irish Springsteen fans have described it as, “This is what people think Irish music sounds like.”) The lyrics are impenetrable, as if he wanted them to feel like a poem. A poem is not a song and vice versa. Bruce pretty much invented the overly wordy rock song and made it work — ahem, “Blinded by the Light” — but the most intelligible word in this four-and-a-half minute shoutfest is “beer.” It’s St. Patrick’s Day for the non-Irish. It’s one of the blandest, least interesting things Springsteen has ever done, especially given the material that inspired it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-12-0-0@published data-word-count=111><strong>331. </strong><a href=#><strong>“The Way,” The Promise</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “The Way” is hidden song at the end of The Promise, tacked on after “City of Night.” It’s a slow, lugubrious ballad with a decent vocal delivery and a solid sax solo. The lyrics describe all the ways his lover belongs to him —&nbsp;until the end, when it gets creepy: “I’d lock you deep inside till the last rains fall/And hide you from the emptiness of it all.” This is probably why, in 2010, Springsteen told a caller on “E Street Radio,” “I would like to see it placed in a David Lynch film over a sexually perverse scene. That, to me, is its righteous home.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-13-0-0@published data-word-count=96><strong>330. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Queen of the Supermarket,” Working on a Dream</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Bruce Springsteen wrote a song about the Whole Foods in Middletown, New Jersey. It’s an unnecessarily ornate rewrite of “Customer” by the Replacements, but I could have gotten behind it if he had gone somewhere assured or interesting. Saying “fucking” in the last verse does not accomplish that. Like much of Working on a Dream, there are too many Brian Wilson fantasies pursued here. If you’re Bruce Springsteen and you want to replicate the Wall of Sound, hire an orchestra and go for it. Don’t stop halfway.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-14-0-0@published data-word-count=21><strong>329. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Surprise, Surprise,” Working on a Dream</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A birthday song that’s used to fulfill Springsteen’s ambition of writing a Raspberries song.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-15-0-0@published data-word-count=24><strong>328. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Lift Me Up,” The Essential Bruce Springsteen</strong></a><strong>.</strong> There are many vocal styles at which Bruce Springsteen excels. Falsetto is not one of them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-16-0-0@published data-word-count=40><strong>327. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Working on a Dream,” Working on a Dream</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Melodically, it’s reminiscent of “Wichita Lineman.” Unfortunately, the lyrics are a dim approximation of every amazing song Springsteen has written about ambition, hope, and faith. He also whistles in two lines.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-17-0-0@published data-word-count=55><strong>326. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Sad Eyes,” Tracks</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is not the ‘78 “Sad Eyes,” but rather the polar opposite, an uncharacteristically mean account of a man deliberately toying with the affections of a vulnerable woman. Springsteen has said that he was thinking of Dionne Warwick when he wrote the melody in the ‘90s. Let’s hope it stays there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-18-0-0@published data-word-count=62><strong>325. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Reno,” Devils & Dust</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This song rose to general attention due to a single lyric: “$250 up the ass.” Frankly, it wouldn’t matter if Springsteen filled a song with obscenities as long as it was in service to the art, but “Reno” is just boring. What’s most disappointing is that he chose to cash in that chip on this particular song.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-19-0-0@published data-word-count=28><strong>324. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Harry’s Place,” High Hopes</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A leftover from the Rising era that sounds like it was recorded in the ‘90s. Clarence’s sax solo is the only redeeming factor.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-20-0-0@published data-word-count=57><strong>323. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Kingdom of Days,” Working on a Dream</strong></a><strong>.</strong> An overly earnest paean to Mrs. Springsteen and a tribute to growing old together, but again, Bruce attempts to cram the Wall of Sound into a space where it doesn’t fit. It would be perfect for an AARP commercial, which is less of a diss than it might seem.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-21-0-0@published data-word-count=41><strong>322. “</strong><a href=#><strong>Let’s Be Friends (Skin to Skin),” The Rising</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It seems like this&nbsp;one was supposed to capture a modern R&B feeling in a song about adult romance and second marriages. The harmonies are great, but the rest of it is cringeworthy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-22-0-0@published data-word-count=62><strong>321. </strong><a href=#><strong>“The Fuse,” The Rising</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It’s hard to figure out what’s happening in this one, or how it fits into the overall thematic arc of the album. There are some very interesting textures and the languid tone definitely conveys a specific emotional detachment.

It seemed like that would be the last we’d heard of the thing, but no, it came back again and again, and then surfaced on this record. There are a lot of nice ideas here —&nbsp;especially the line “when all of our victories and glories have turned into parking lots.” (It reminds me of my late, lamented Shea Stadium, and I’m sure it does the same for other fans in similar shoes.) A song about how Americans love to tear things down certainly makes sense with the rest of the album, but that’s not what this song is. “For most, music is primarily an emotional language; whatever you’ve written lyrically almost always comes in second to what the listener is feeling.” Bruce wrote that about “Born in the U.S.A.” but it also describes the audience’s reaction to “Wrecking Ball.” It’s a bunch of disparate, unconnected ideas soundtracked against energetic and inspiring music, and eventually, the lack of substance in the lyrics starts to wear thin.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-33-0-0@published data-word-count=42><strong>310. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Living on the Edge of the World,” Tracks</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A great idea trapped an annoying, cloying, unnecessarily busy musical landscape.

As if there’s some genuine closure happening.

So, we got “Factory.” Springsteen has written so many sympathetic, illuminating songs about the plight of the blue-collar worker —&nbsp;some of which are right alongside “Factory” —&nbsp;and yet it completely eludes him here.

Parts of it sound like various Magic-era songs, which isn’t so far-fetched given that Springsteen was working on this record at least as far back as 2012, and we know he likes to reuse bits of lyrics or melodies until he thinks he’s gotten it right.

He was ready to make music with another band, but didn’t have anything pulled together just yet. As he told MOJO in 1999, “In the meantime, I wrote about half a record on the bass, where you had a note and you had your idea,” which perfectly describes this song, one of the stronger numbers from that period.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-123-0-0@published data-word-count=49><strong>208. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Devil’s Arcade,” Magic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Despondent and forlorn, but still very rock and roll, “Devil’s Arcade” is part of a trio of songs Springsteen wrote about soldiers killed in Iraq.

After all, Springsteen wrote the song to poke fun at the kinds of things written about him in the gossip sections. On tour, however, it transformed into a political statement about the L.A. riots. Borrowing techniques from U2’s ZooTV tour and Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy’s “Television, the Drug of a Nation,” they looped news broadcasts and heavy guitar feedback onstage, turning that bass-heavy romp into an attempt at pointed commentary.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-125-0-0@published data-word-count=85><strong>206. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Ain’t Good Enough for You,” The Promise</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A period piece that’s almost in the same vein of “Seaside Bar Song.” It’s deliberately meant to sound like it comes from another era. Give a good listen to the earnest and hopeful vocals, underpinned by bright piano and baritone sax as the E Street Band sings backing vocals, with those party noises on the bridge. If the song had actually made it onto Darkness, one would hope that Springsteen planned to cut the Jimmy Iovine line.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-126-0-0@published data-word-count=31><strong>205. </strong><a href=#><strong>“The Wall,” High Hopes</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A heartfelt tribute to friends from the Jersey Shore who went to Vietnam and didn’t come home.

When he was putting the box set together, he asked around for some suggestions, and a friend gave him a tape with the song on it. As he told MOJO in 1998, “[It] was just something that I didn’t get at the time I did it.” The last verse has real power —&nbsp;and musically, it’s a complete thought&nbsp;—&nbsp;but the song was too much to include on Darkness, and it didn’t make sense for anything that followed.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-128-0-0@published data-word-count=66><strong>203. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Spanish Eyes,” The Promise</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Sultry and heated, this underrated song should have been used for something, even if it never fit on Darkness.

He opens the record with this problem statement: Despite everything that might follow, love still eludes him. The vocals are an utterly irresistible mix of Elvis and Orbison, which really shine against the song’s sparse background. It’s heartbreak wrapped up in a rockabilly overcoat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-135-0-0@published data-word-count=64><strong>195. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Straight Time,” The Ghost of Tom Joad</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It’s not just the specificity of the details that makes this one so painful, but the details Springsteen chooses to focus on.

And, in its own way, Springsteen’s ability to recall the small, specific details of the past — like the line about the pool cues going back on the wall — and place them perfectly in the present is the ultimate tribute. It’s also one of many elements of his songwriting that makes it consistently compelling. Musical highlights include a gorgeous sax solo from Jake Clemons that his uncle would be proud of and Roy Bittan on the glockenspiel in homage to Danny Federici. On the other hand, the echo on the chorus is both out of context and jarring.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-139-0-0@published data-word-count=83><strong>189. </strong><a href=#><strong>“The Last Carnival,” Working on a Dream</strong></a><strong>.</strong> “The Last Carnival” was written for Federici, who died in 2008. Springsteen invokes Wild Billy and two kids running away to join the circus, over a quiet acoustic background, with an ethereal chorus against a fairground calliope until fadeout. Danny was the longest tenured member of the E Street Band — he stuck with Bruce through the thin times, the bad times, and the good times —&nbsp;so the analogy could not be more heartbreakingly apt.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxaw3x7y001h3h65i8uujhs6@published data-word-count=92><strong>188. “Hitch Hikin’,” Western Stars</strong>. The opening cut on Bruce’s latest album begins so quietly and minimally you think it will be a normal Springsteen acoustic song. His voice and guitar share a gentle melody through the first verse and chorus, but a minute in, as we reach the second verse, the strings coast in from behind and the acceleration expands in the verses and choruses to follow. It’s the sound of the road, of forward movement; it’s light and airy and feels like big fluffy clouds casting shadows on the freeway.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-140-0-0@published data-word-count=61><strong>187. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Heaven’s Wall,” High Hopes</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Bruce toyed with the idea of a gospel album, brought the closest thing he’s ever had to a gospel choir on the road with him, and this song was an excuse to play in that sandbox for a bit longer. The guitar duel between Springsteen and Tom Morello is the most interesting part, to be honest.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgtjetxf00113h65rtcmtr9i@published data-word-count=82><strong>186. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Janey Needs a Shooter,” Letter to You</strong></a><br><strong></strong>The inclusion of this legendary outtake 50 or so years later feels like unfinished business. You might know Warren Zevon’s version of it, called “Jeannie Needs a Shooter,” from 1980’s Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School. But you’d have to be a diligent die hard hanging out in the bootleg section of the record store to have ever heard either Bruce’s early ’70s solo takes or a later 1979 E Street Band rehearsal of it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgtjf4rw00173h65a0fezx1v@published data-word-count=116>The solo versions are Bruce trying to be Dylan — the early demos feel like he’s generously borrowing from an “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)” vibe. The band rehearsal version was brutal, adjacent to the kind of noir atmosphere captured in “Point Blank.” The 2019 version feels more like the old-timer telling a ghost story around the campfire. It doesn’t have the same smoldering intensity as the ’79 version, but it is big and loud and full of life; it will shake and fill your solar plexus. I wish Danny Federici was still with us to hear what he would have done with it — all props to Charles Giordano for stepping into those shoes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-141-0-0@published data-word-count=42><strong>185. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Souls of the Departed,” Lucky Town</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Springsteen approaches the first Gulf War and Los Angeles gang wars with a dark, haunting melody, using low chords, slide, and a deep blues harmonica to tell a tale of harsh reality and grim choices.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-142-0-0@published data-word-count=25><strong>184. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Trouble River,” 18 Tracks</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It’s another soul shouter, a kissing cousin to “Seven Angels.” Wait for that “WOO!” at the three-minute mark and rejoice.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-143-0-0@published data-word-count=95><strong>183. </strong><a href=#><strong>“The New Timer,” The Ghost of Tom Joad</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The melody sounds like the rhythm of a freight train. It’s a story about the modern hobos, about a man who leaves his family in search of work. “New Timer” was inspired by Journey to Nowhere, an amazing book by Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson. Like that book, the song shows rather than tells. As Springsteen wrote in the book’s second printing, “What would I do to take care of my family?

It works because he genuinely means it. And he tells this story in a delightfully jangly, 12-string strummed anthem (courtesy of Little Steven Van Zandt). The breakdown at the end is textbook, classic E Street: sax solo, handclaps, la la la las, cymbal crashes, piano chords raining down. You can already envision 30,000 people on their feet, singing the chorus: “I’m alive / and I’m coming home.” “Sometimes you write a song to hear the audience sing it back at you,” the Boss said once.

As he told Peter Ames Carlin, “I realized I didn’t know how to be married.” He reveals these feelings over a minimal background, acoustic guitar, and the synth buried low. His vocals are laid bare, nothing buried in the tune, his voice on the edge of anguish.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-162-0-0@published data-word-count=81><strong>160. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Magic,” Magic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This one is arranged with sounds you don’t expect in order to be discomfiting and uncomfortable. It’s certainly an appropriate mood for a song with the line, “Trust none of what you hear/and less of what you see.” Bruce is trying so hard to reveal that something is happening over there while the government is making us look over here. Then, he reinforces the point by going into “Last to Die,” a song about the never-ending body count.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-163-0-0@published data-word-count=47><strong>159. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Frankie Fell in Love,” High Hopes</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A glimmer of hope buried within this grab bag of a record, “Frankie Fell in Love” brims with exuberance and fun.

The song has an infectious backbeat, and Bruce relishes the challenge of singing with another strong vocalist. And, of course, it lets him indulge his <a href=#>Sam & Dave</a> fantasies.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgtj93yd000h3h65o23tbead@published data-word-count=158><strong>156. </strong><a href=#><strong>“If I Was the Priest,” Letter to You</strong></a><br><strong></strong>Out of the three early songs that Springsteen selected for this album, this is probably the most pleasant surprise. The early demos floating around the fan community are Bruce and a piano, where he sounds like he’s trying to be Leon Russell; what makes this version irresistible is that while he hasn’t changed the lyrics or the melody, his phrasing and intonation are urgent and he’s delivering them with the authority and confidence gained in those intervening years, backed by an E Street Band in full command of their powers. The organ is more Garth Hudson than Danny Federici, but that’s okay, because it is accurate to the period in which the song was written, and the rest of the melody wouldn’t be out of place on a country playlist on Spotify. While the lyrics definitely harken back to Bruce’s&nbsp;“nuns run bald in Vatican halls” period, it avoids feeling dated.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-165-0-0@published data-word-count=22><strong>155. </strong><a href=#><strong>“From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),” The Essential Bruce Springsteen</strong></a><strong>.</strong> A delightful classic rockabilly romp from end to end.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-166-0-0@published data-word-count=69><strong>154. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Long Time Coming,” Devils & Dust</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Most musicians can only wish they had random songs like “Long Time Coming” lying around. As an opening track to 2005’s Devils & Dust, it’s sweet enough, with interesting imagery. It’s too bad Springsteen detracts from it all by throwing in “Ain’t gonna fuck it up this time,” which is cheap, jarring, and just plain out of character for the song’s tone.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-167-0-0@published data-word-count=38><strong>153. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Seven Angels,” Tracks</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The vocals, equal parts dominant and relaxed, sell this ‘90s-era outtake.

He’s moved from telling stories about him, to writing about people like him (“Factory”), to writing songs about him directly (“Independence Day”), to this poignant, partly autobiographical number. Take note of the verse about Freehold: “We lived in the shadow of the elms” refers to his childhood home adjacent to St. Rose of Lima. The house is gone, but the tree still stands.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-171-0-0@published data-word-count=78><strong>149. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Lonesome Day,” The Rising</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Bruce’s song-sequencing instincts are highly underrated, never more so than with this record. The Rising doesn’t charge in with songs about faith or revenge, but rather with the one song that’s about the day after —&nbsp;the first day of everyday life for the person left behind. It’s upbeat but driven, capturing the force of will&nbsp;needed to put one foot in front of the other after your heart is ripped out of your chest.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-172-0-0@published data-word-count=98><strong>148. </strong><a href=#><strong>“A Night With the Jersey Devil,” (online-only single)</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Bruce Springsteen absolutely, genuinely loves Halloween. Whenever he plays on Halloween, there’s always something special in the set list: In 1980, he had his roadies (dressed up like ghouls) carry him onstage in a coffin, and when he climbed out,<a href=#> he led the band in “Haunted House” by Johnny Fuller</a>. Here, Bruce manages to combine both Halloween and New Jersey legends —&nbsp;the <a href=#>Jersey Devil</a> is basically a Satanic Bigfoot — running his vocals through distortion and a bullet mic over a stop-time blues beat. It’s a lot of fun.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxaw1oi000123h65ywr7ntlr@published data-word-count=125><strong>147. “Western Stars,” Western Stars.</strong> It’s not surprising that Springsteen would be fascinated by the aging characters of Hollywood and want to write about them, and he offers here a slightly self-deprecating narration ornamented by spectral touches of pedal steel. But what absolutely elevates this track is that enormous, heart-swelling orchestral flourish in the last minute: Springsteen’s voice rises to meet it, evoking a Western landscape where the desert meets the sky. (Plus, how many rock songs mention Viagra so brazenly?) It reminds me of a passage from the Born to Run book (also part of Springsteen on Broadway) in which he talks about his first time out West: “It all felt like home, and I fell into a lasting love affair with the desert.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgtj5rsy000c3h65b761j1bc@published data-word-count=182><strong>146. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Rainmaker,”&nbsp;Letter to You</strong></a><br><strong></strong>It’s the best song on Letter to You, even if it didn’t originate from the same time period of the other new songs, even though it absolutely does not fit either within the narrative arc or the musical vocabulary of the record. It could have fit on Wrecking Ball, somewhere between “We Take Care of Our Own” and “Easy Money,” lyrically and sonically. The melody is evocative, broad as a western landscape; the vocal delivery full of weary frustration and underscored by highly satisfying gigantic guitar chords that sound like thunder and lighting. “Rainmaker” is a stark commentary about the human need to believe, the motivation and the consequences, written from the perspective of someone in the story who’s observing and narrating, but not judging — rather just trying to work it out for himself, a common quality of all his best songs. Springsteen states he wrote the song many years before the current occupant of the White House, but that doesn’t mean the song still isn’t about him and everyone like him in history or still to come.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-173-0-0@published data-word-count=56><strong>145. </strong><a href=#><strong>“Across the Border,” The Ghost of Tom Joad</strong></a><strong>.</strong> We don’t know if the narrator is dying, going home, or crossing an actual border to go home, but you will weep by the end of this song.

With a strong assist from Chuck Berry, the Boss pays tribute to the King with this simple, pointed, almost-rockabilly track. He initially recorded the demo with a drum machine and could have re-recorded it with real drums at any point, yet chose not to. The mechanical drums against Berry’s riff creates a deliberate emotional isolation that very much fits the lyrics. (If you ever go to Memphis, play it right as you turn onto Elvis Presley Boulevard on your way to Graceland. It’ll add yet another dimension to the track.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-175-0-0@published data-word-count=62><strong>143. </strong><a href=#><strong>“The Wrestler,” Working on a Dream</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Springsteen deservedly won the Grammy and the Golden Globe for this song, which he wrote for <a href=#>the Mickey Rourke/Darren Aronofsky film of the same name</a>. Springsteen’s gift of compression aids him both lyrically and musically, and he captures so much atmosphere and emotion in under four minutes —&nbsp;just enough time for the credits to roll.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjxavzlvz000x3h65gdo8sa9j@published data-word-count=63><strong>142. “There Goes My Miracle,” Western Stars.</strong> What I hear in this song is Ronnie Spector and the Wall of Sound, maybe a little Smokey Robinson for good measure. It’s all in there, layer upon layer of gorgeous classic pop, the time-tested formula of a heartbreaking story juxtaposed against a soaring melody. It is timeless in the best way, glorious and soul affirming.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-176-0-0@published data-word-count=73><strong>141. <a href=#>“Mary’s Place,” The Rising</a>.</strong> The theme of “Mary’s Place” is right in Springsteen’s wheelhouse, which is why it’s disappointing that the results are so uneven. The core of the story —&nbsp;“Tell me how do you live brokenhearted?” —&nbsp;displays phenomenal insight. The idea of using music as a form of prayer is a beautiful sentiment.

First, an early rockabilly version was cut early in the 1980–81 recording sessions that led up to The River. It’s always fun to hear Bruce try to be Elvis or Jerry Lee (more Jerry Lee here), and he stretches out of his comfort zone with interesting results. The River version is just a straight-ahead rocker, so it fits better with the record overall, but the rockabilly version absolutely has more depth.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-182-0-0@published data-word-count=101><strong>135. <a href=#>“Jack of All Trades,” Wrecking Ball</a>.</strong> The quietest song on the record, but easily the angriest. Exhaustion and desperation tinge Springsteen’s voice as he drives the melody toward a neat, Coplandesque bridge. He asks a lot of questions here without actually asking any actual questions. “Jack of all Trades” also has the honor of being number-two on the list of most misunderstood Springsteen songs, because people always applaud enthusiastically at the line, “If I had me a gun, I’d find the bastards and shoot ‘em on sight,” which is not a line to applaud in any fashion for any reason.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-183-0-0@published data-word-count=96><strong>134. <a href=#>“Wild Billy’s Circus Story,” The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle</a>.</strong> The power of this song lies in its specificity, the little details and the big ones. “It was also a song about the seduction and loneliness of a life outside the margins of everyday life,” Springsteen writes in Songs. He sets the tone with tuba, accordion, acoustic guitar, and mandolin, telling the story of a circus from setting up and settling in to packing up and moving on. “Hey son, you wanna try the big top? All aboard, Nebraska’s our next stop.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-184-0-0@published data-word-count=58><strong>133. <a href=#>“Shut Out the Light,” Tracks</a>.</strong> An unfortunate outcome of “Born in the U.S.A.” domination: Springsteen’s other tremendous songs about Vietnam veteran homecomings are sadly overlooked. This stunning chronicle was actually a non-album B-side for “Born in the U.S.A.,” sharpening a very real point.

Wrapped up in some assertive, bold acoustic playing, it’s a wry, self-deprecating reflection of the by-products of fame. You won’t forget the payoff line: “These days I’m feeling all right/’Cept I can’t tell my courage from my desperation.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-191-0-0@published data-word-count=110><strong>126. <a href=#>“Jackson Cage,” The River</a>.</strong> I’ll be honest: Even after all these years, I’m still not sure what the Jackson Cage is meant to be. Yes, it’s a metaphor for being trapped by the circumstances of one’s life and yearning for a way out. But Springsteen also talks about “crossed swords on the killing floor” (a phrase he likes to use, but rarely deploys with success), which seems a bit brutal, all things considered. It’s a solid melody and a fine performance, but when I hear it, I mostly just think of “Roulette” and the other songs that didn’t make The River. What distinguished this particular cut in his mind?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-192-0-0@published data-word-count=88><strong>125. <a href=#>“Give the Girl a Kiss,” Tracks</a>.</strong> This is the kind of song Springsteen thinks about when he describes why The River needed tracks that evoked an E Street Band show. Initially recorded for Darkness, it sounds like a cover —&nbsp;and to be fair, it’s based roughly on&nbsp;<a href=#>a Shangri-Las song with a similar title</a> — but it’s a glorious, raucous celebration of the music at the roots of the band, featuring the Horns of Love to boot. Clemons’s wonderfully deep bass voice sings us out at the end.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-193-0-0@published data-word-count=39><strong>124. <a href=#>“You’re Missing,” The Rising</a>.</strong> In Songs, Springsteen describes this track as “the daily details of loss.” It’s a recitation of the small things, but his vocal delivery carries remarkable emotional tenor.

The good-time sax solo and get-down party music juxtapose with the lyrics in such a strong way. Bruce wants us to understand the hypocrisy of violating basic American civil liberties in the name of keeping America safe.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-196-0-0@published data-word-count=75><strong>121. <a href=#>“Lucky Town,” Lucky Town</a>.</strong> With all those clever turns of phrase, this song gets better every time you listen to it. The singing and performances feel loose and relaxed, but it’s quite deep. “Lucky Town” fits right in alongside the album’s other songs about relationships, growing up, and commitment. It’s one of the twangier numbers, both in instrumentation and vocal delivery. This tale of the inveterate rambler rolling to a stop is a keeper.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-197-0-0@published data-word-count=57><strong>120. <a href=#>“Fire,” The Promise</a>.</strong> Springsteen wrote “Fire” for Elvis. Think about that again: He wrote it for Elvis Presley. It’s so sad that the song went to Robert Gordon, not just because Elvis died before Springsteen ever got a response, but also because this is the closest to the King that Springsteen would ever let himself be.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-198-0-0@published data-word-count=137><b>119. <a href=#>“Paradise by the ‘C’,” <i>The Ties That Bind</i></a>.</b> Star time! “Paradise” is Springsteen’s only all-instrumental composition, and it exists solely to put the spotlight on the Big Man.

(Its inclusion was one of the things they got right with that release.) It was played frequently on the ‘78 tour and in Europe in ‘88, but hasn’t surfaced since. For reasons beyond anyone’s understanding, a studio version was included in the <i>The Ties That Bind</i> box set, even though it is highly unlikely the song was actually recorded during that period.

The track has its basis in the <a href=#>Starkweather killings</a>; he saw Badlands, which led him to a book written by <a href=#>a local journalist named Ninette Beaver</a>, whom he would also interview.

If you could bottle the sound of that one night, this is what it would be. There’s Bo Diddley guitar, Farfisa organ, Springsteen exuberantly tumbling through the lyrics, and a buoyant sax solo. “Daddy, can’t you turn up the radio any louder?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-202-0-0@published data-word-count=32><strong>115. <a href=#>“I’m on Fire,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> Definitely one for the ladies. “I’m on Fire” is a tale of smoldering lust, sung in a seductively sullen croon against an insistent backbeat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-203-0-0@published data-word-count=83><strong>114. <a href=#>“Frankie,” Tracks</a>.</strong> This seven-minute epic outtake&nbsp;was first performed in the spring of 1976. Springsteen has such strong instincts about arrangements that the listener never gets lost, and to be sure, “Frankie” has some ambitious and wonderful moments. (Even if he did them better, both musically and thematically, on “Kitty’s Back” and “Rosalita.”) The song ranks where it does because witnessing the E Street Band perform it is a tremendous moment, provided the bozos next to you don’t talk through the whole thing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-204-0-0@published data-word-count=87><strong>113. <a href=#>“Radio Nowhere,” Magic</a>.</strong> A perfect single, a heartfelt paean to the days of catching AM signals across the country, an anthem to the power of the radio airwaves. Bonus points given for Springsteen finally figuring out how to use “Is anybody really alive out there?” in a song. The Elvis invocation closes the loop, reaffirming Springsteen’s connection to the days when <a href=#>Dewey Phillips</a> was broadcasting on WHBQ, when <a href=#>Cousin Brucie</a> was on WABC in New York, when <a href=#>Kid Leo</a> was coming out of Cleveland on WMMS.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-205-0-0@published data-word-count=46><strong>112. <a href=#>“Crush on You,” The River</a>.</strong> The song owes a lot to punk rock. It’s fun, breathless, and exciting, as Springsteen spits out the words with exaggerated deliberateness and Clemons blows his best King Curtis riff in the background. A highly underrated number in the catalogue.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-206-0-0@published data-word-count=133><strong>111. <a href=#>“Thundercrack,” Tracks</a>.</strong> A legend in fan circles, Springsteen wrote “Thundercrack” back in the days when no one knew who he was. He wanted to leave audiences with something they weren’t expecting, something that would change directions multiple times: “It was just a big, epic show-ender that was meant to leave the audience gasping a little bit for their breath,” he told MOJO in 1998. It’s a boundless, fantastic adventure, with swooping organ, jazzy drums, harmony vocals, tasteful guitar solos, reprises and bridges and instrumental breaks, multiple sax solos, and plenty of opportunity for audience participation. The first time I heard this song live, at Asbury Park Convention Hall, a couple thousand people circled their hands in the air “round and round and round and round.” It was nothing short of sheer magic.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-207-0-0@published data-word-count=54><strong>110. <a href=#>“Where the Bands Are,” Tracks</a>.</strong> Disc two strikes again!&nbsp;That side harmony on the choruses is straight out of the Van Zandt Power-Pop Playbook.

It embodies the sultry, languid attitude of a cocksure young Casanova, with the music to match. There are maracas (“The instruments of love,” Springsteen declared while introducing the song in 2015), there is a cha-cha beat, and there is that one moment before the last verse when&nbsp;Springsteen pauses and takes a breath: “Oh darlin’,” he sings, mustering all of the hope and innocence and desire of the previous verses, channeling his best Roy Orbison.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-209-0-0@published data-word-count=86><strong>108. <a href=#>“Don’t Look Back,” Tracks</a>.</strong> This is what it sounds like when Springsteen pursues his power-pop agenda, even though the vocal delivery belongs on a rock-and-roll number. The song didn’t work convincingly enough to make it onto Darkness —&nbsp;and when Bruce gave it away to the Knack, they also sidelined it. For all of its good points, “Don’t Look Back” isn’t really about anything, which is probably why it got cut. Nevertheless, “You gotta walk it, talk it, in your heart” is a perfect, unforgettable line.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-210-0-0@published data-word-count=55><strong>107. <a href=#>“Wages of Sin,” Tracks</a>.</strong> This song catches you by surprise. It opens with random guitar strumming, then the band comes in solemnly, with an almost-orchestral sound.

Technically, it’s just a few steps from his rewritten version of “A Love So Fine” by the Chiffons. (Recognize the “rat traps filled with soul crusaders” line?) The vocals are full of exuberance and ecstasy, and Clemons is the unequivocal star, his sax running a counterpoint beneath the vocal melody. “Meant to blow your head off,” Bruce told MOJO in 1998.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-215-0-0@published data-word-count=44><strong>102. <a href=#>“Brothers Under the Bridge,” Tracks</a>.</strong> Not to be confused with “Brothers Under the Bridge (’83),” this Joad outtake considers the experience of Vietnam veterans after they returned home.

Fierce harmonica and a quick pace mirror Janey’s stream of consciousness, as anguish pushes her to the very edge.

It almost overreaches —&nbsp;“nuns run bald through Vatican halls” and all that —&nbsp;but the song ultimately tips the right way because the music is both grand and understated. It swells when it should, then drops back down in the next measure. “He leans on the hood telling racin’ stories, the kids call him Jimmy the Saint,” is the moment when the melody explodes to life, as David Sancious hits the notes like he’s playing in a distinguished symphony hall. When it’s performed live, “Lost in the Flood” is the E Street Band at its finest: thundering mightily, but with absolute control, able to stop at the lift of a hand or the strike of a heel.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-220-0-0@published data-word-count=62><strong>97. <a href=#>“Pink Cadillac,” Tracks</a>.</strong> Springsteen put it best in the notes he sent to Jon Landau with the Nebraska cassette: “Self-explanatory.” The music is down and dirty, embodying the sound of bar band in the corner of a dive with a packed dance floor “on a Saturday night.” Extra points for “My love is bigger than a Honda/It’s bigger than a Subaru.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-221-0-0@published data-word-count=51><strong>96. <a href=#>“The Wish,” Tracks</a>.</strong> Directly autobiographical, “The Wish” is the touching story of how Adele Springsteen used money the family didn’t have to buy Bruce a guitar. The best moment comes at the end, when he switches from past tense to present tense:&nbsp;“Well, tonight I’m taking requests here in the kitchen.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-222-0-0@published data-word-count=106><strong>95. <a href=#>“Two Hearts,” The River</a>.</strong> Here’s one of the lighter moments on The River, a bridge between the heartrending ballads and tales of misery. It’s a fairly straight-ahead proposition: “Two hearts are better than one.” Springsteen tells a tale that could be about anyone, male or female, about thinking you’re tough enough to not need a companion. His voice is open and full of yearning, Van Zandt adds delightful harmony vocals in counterpoint, and a quasi-Farfisa organ noodles in the background. That’s probably the best part of the track,&nbsp;which is suiting, since it’s the last thing you hear before one final drum roll closes things out.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-223-0-0@published data-word-count=105><strong>94. <a href=#>“Man at the Top,” Tracks</a>.</strong> “The real dream is not the dream, it’s life without complications. And that doesn’t exist,” Springsteen told <a href=#>Rolling Stone in 1987</a>. There’s a little gospel flavor on this Born in the U.S.A. outtake, but the melody is almost too lightweight for the lyrics. When it’s performed live without the extraneous ornamentation, you feel its bones and the strength of the composition. (Yes, he’s only done it three times, but <a href=#>it was still breathtaking</a>.) Regardless of form, the line “Here comes a kid with a guitar in his hand/Dreaming of his record in number-one spot” always tugs at the heartstrings.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-224-0-0@published data-word-count=71><strong>93. <a href=#>“Downbound Train,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> This would be a sad story of lost love and regret, but two elements elevate it: the lonely, hollow organ chords underneath the main melody, and the bridge. When the rest of the band drops out, it’s just Springsteen’s voice and the aforementioned organ notes, which, bereft of surrounding instrumentation, sound like a train whistle echoing in the distance. So simple, yet so compelling.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-225-0-0@published data-word-count=88><strong>92. <a href=#>“Into the Fire,” The Rising</a>.</strong> The first song Springsteen wrote for the album. In Songs, he suggests it was “a folk blues with a gospel chorus, the grittiness and sacrifice of the blues giving the gospel elements … their meaning.” He continues: “The picture I couldn’t let go of was the emergency workers going up the stairs as others rushed down to safety. The sense of duty, the courage. Ascending into …&nbsp;what?” My brother is a firefighter, and I cannot listen to this song without choking up.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-226-0-0@published data-word-count=84><strong>91. <a href=#>“Back in Your Arms,” Tracks</a>.</strong> We saw Bruce working this one on the Blood Brothers DVD, it was filmed during the Greatest Hits recording sessions, and then it disappeared until Tracks. He has a considerable amount of pride and vanity around his soul voice —&nbsp;it’s no small thing to directly emulate your idols — and he goes full-throttle here, invoking Otis Redding’s “These Arms of Mine” and “That’s How Strong My Love Is.” Big shoes to fill, and this is a worthy attempt.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-227-0-0@published data-word-count=96><strong>90. <a href=#>“Better Days,” Lucky Town</a>.</strong> An optimistic, boisterous statement of intent. Better days didn’t simply show up; he’s willing them into existence. “Tonight I’m laying in your arms carvin’ lucky charms,” Springsteen sings, “Out of these hard luck bones.” The affirmation reappears in the third verse, when he roars, “This fool’s halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell/And I feel like I’m coming home.” The melody consists mostly of a sequence of organ chords, with a handful of guitar notes sprinkled over the top. The emotion in the vocals is what sells the song.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-228-0-0@published data-word-count=102><strong>89. <a href=#>“Something in the Night,” Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.</strong> One of Springsteen’s great driving songs. The first verse says it all: “Turn the radio up loud so I don’t have to think at all.” Bruce pulls a great soulful vocal out from the center of his chest, while the E Street Band nails a complex orchestral performances that’s so subtle and nuanced you almost don’t feel it. The band drops away before the end, leaving a kick drum behind Springsteen while he reveals the story’s end. Everybody jumps back in, though, as Bruce keens with anguish to close the track.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-229-0-0@published data-word-count=57><strong>88. <a href=#>“One Step Up,” Tunnel of Love</a>.</strong> Springsteen notes that this is one of four songs on Tunnel of Love that “tell the story of men whose inner sense of themselves is in doubt.” Doubt is the key element here, reflected in the uncertain pace of the vocals, as Springsteen sings over a quietly repetitive acoustic guitar.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-230-0-0@published data-word-count=69><strong>87. <a href=#>“Meeting Across the River,” Born to Run</a>.</strong> Springsteen at his most dramatic and deliberately cinematic. It’s more musical theater than rock and roll, more jazz than anything else. Bruce’s voice is the main instrument, accompanied by a haunting, unforgettable trumpet melody that’s backed by double bass and piano. Although it’s been performed without going straight into “Jungleland,” the stars align for a split second every time it is.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-231-0-0@published data-word-count=54><strong>86. <a href=#>“Valentine’s Day,” Tunnel of Love</a>.</strong> A song called “Valentine’s Day” that you would never want to hear on Valentine’s Day. It’s a story about running away, about fear, about facing what you know you want. It’s not manic or driven, but gently loping. Springsteen’s voice hovers naked above the mix, full of hope.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-232-0-0@published data-word-count=103><strong>85. <a href=#>“I Wanna Be With You,” Tracks</a>.</strong> Pure pop for modern people. The song opens with a near-perfect, suspenseful intro that features eight beats of guitar chord, before Springsteen’s “Hey!” brings in Bittan’s power chords. That’s when the vocals slam the door open: “Let the frozen cities crumble, crumble and fall.” Bruce sings with a determined abandon, openly declaring his love. He loosens up even more in the last verse, just after a warm and bubbly sax solo from Clemons. The title gives it away, but “I Wanna Be With You” is meant to be an unabashed Raspberries tribute. It more than succeeds.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-233-0-0@published data-word-count=74><strong>84. <a href=#>“Blinded by the Light,” Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</a></strong> In a simple and unadorned way, Springsteen uses language as another instrument: “Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer,” “in the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps,” those mmms functioning as a bass line. As an opening salvo, “Blinded by the Light” remains impressive, even if a little bit naïve. It’s an impressionist painting of Jersey Shore life and its characters.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-234-0-0@published data-word-count=32><strong>83. <a href=#>“If I Should Fall Behind,” Lucky Town</a>.</strong> The number-one wedding song for Springsteen fans offers a lovely, simple promise: “I’ll wait for you/And if I should fall behind wait for me.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-235-0-0@published data-word-count=118><strong>82. <a href=#>“Cover Me,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> Springsteen has a habit of writing songs for other people, then liking them so much he hangs on to them. “Hungry Heart” is probably the most well-known —&nbsp;he famously <a href=#>wrote it for the Ramones</a> — but “Cover Me” is another great example. He wrote it for Donna Summer, as he explains in Songs: “She could really sing and I disliked the veiled racism of the anti-disco movement.” Rhythmically, you can hear how this song was meant for Summer. The E Street Band is perfectly dialed into that groove, but Bruce plants it firmly back on his side of the road with sharp, incisive guitar solos that slice right through the beat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-236-0-0@published data-word-count=69><strong>81. <a href=#>“Murder Incorporated,” Greatest Hits</a>.</strong> A full-throttle rocker, the kind of song that the E Street Band eats for lunch. Initially an outtake from Born in the U.S.A., “Murder Incorporated” is supposed to be a metaphor for “the paranoia and compounded violence of life in America,” but when it’s played live, most people are too busy shaking their asses to think about any larger meaning —&nbsp;and that’s totally okay.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-237-0-0@published data-word-count=61><strong>80. <a href=#>“It’s So Hard to Be a Saint in the City,” Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</a></strong> “Saint” is a street epic. It’s a view of New York through the eyes of a kid who arrived from somewhere else, who sees significance in the mundane. Springsteen delivers the best of his street-hipster cool alongside a musical arrangement that does the story justice.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-238-0-0@published data-word-count=75><strong>79. <a href=#>“Ramrod,” The River</a>.</strong> Just so much fun. “Ramrod” is loose and dirty. It’s the E Street Band as a good-time, party-rock bar band. It’s Tallent and Clemons anchoring the song, swinging deep and low along the bottom. It’s Federici swinging in the back with that Farfisa-like beat. This unequivocal gem is positioned on The River right between “Stolen Car” and “The Price You Pay,” giving the listener some life and a glimmer of hope.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-239-0-0@published data-word-count=185><strong>78. <a href=#>“Out in the Street,” The River</a>.</strong> Springsteen has a special knack for capturing the ritual of getting ready to go out on the weekend. It’s there in “Night” on Born to Run, and it’s on this track from The River. “Out in the Street” is full of excitement and anticipation, that feeling of changing out of work clothes and into party clothes, heading out the door and leaving the week behind. Springsteen’s voice is eager and full of promise, and Clarence’s sax solo is the sound of your friends honking at you from downstairs to get out here already. To understand what makes “Out in the Street” so great, just listen to the second verse: “And Monday when the foreman calls time/I’ve already got Friday on my mind.” It’s a blatant and direct lift from the Easybeats’ “Friday on My Mind,” which Springsteen might have played during his days gigging up and down the Jersey Shore in cover bands. He would return the favor in 2014, when hefinally covered “Friday on My Mind” <a href=#>while touring in Australia</a>. It was a ferocious, note-perfect tribute.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-240-0-0@published data-word-count=162><strong>77. <a href=#>“The Fever,” 18 Tracks</a>.</strong> Springsteen gave this one away, folks. He wrote it and gave it to Southside Johnny, who recorded and released <a href=#>a fine version</a>, to be sure. “Fever” was recorded as part of the Wild & Innocent sessions, and it was distributed to friendly radio stations to build anticipation for the next record. If you lived in a Springsteen stronghold, you might have known it already, or maybe you heard it live on the ‘78 tour. It’s a loose and languid song, and it embraces a different kind of smoldering soulfulness than the Asbury Jukes version. (Southside is more Otis, Bruce is more Sam Cooke.) The E Street arrangement is jazzy, dominated by piano, organ, cymbals, finger snaps, and the best part, the band singing on the choruses. “Fever” is also a vivid snapshot of the E Street Band at a very particular place and time, when they were still lost boys. There’s something melancholy and wistful about that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-241-0-0@published data-word-count=64><strong>76. <a href=#>“Loose Ends,” Tracks</a>.</strong> The pure pop sensibility of “Loose Ends” is undeniably fabulous, the story is heart-wrenching, and the verses are solid …&nbsp;but there’s something about the language that feels awkward. See: “It’s like we had a noose and baby without check/We pulled until it grew tighter around our necks.” Though it’s a fascinating premise, it doesn’t scan as smoothly as it should.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-242-0-0@published data-word-count=93><strong>75. <a href=#>“Last to Die,” Magic</a>.</strong> “We don’t measure the blood we’ve drawn anymore/We just stack the bodies outside the door,” Springsteen sings, wondering when the killing will end. His voice is filled with a mixture of resignation and desperation, which crashes against a frantic, agitated, full-on rock performance. The emotion of “Last to Die” feels less abstract and more personal, and I’ve often wondered if the anguish doesn’t come from Bruce’s personal guilt about avoiding the Vietnam draft, about watching his friends, neighbors, bandmates, and fellow musicians go off and never come back.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-243-0-0@published data-word-count=100><strong>74. <a href=#>“Living Proof,” Lucky Town</a>.</strong> “Children are the ‘living proof’ of our belief in one another, that love is real,” Springsteen notes in Songs. Written not long after the birth of his first child, Bruce reaffirms that question he has attempted to answer throughout his career: “I want to know if love is real.” The song is solemn, but offers a declaration: This is truth, this is understanding, this is life. His voice carries exultation and relief, buoyed by ringing, heraldic guitar chords. Yes, the synthesizer comes in eventually, but the guitar and vocals are righteous enough to overlook it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-244-0-0@published data-word-count=50><strong>73. <a href=#>“Restless Nights,” Tracks</a>.</strong> Opening disc two of Tracks, also known as “Steve Van Zandt’s Favorite Springsteen Record,” this luscious pop melody belies dark lyrics. (“My baby, she has restless nights.”) There’s a shimmering organ line from Federici on the bridge, a nice little guitar solo, and some tight harmonies.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-245-0-0@published data-word-count=148><strong>72. <a href=#>“Sherry Darling,” The River</a>.</strong> Springsteen’s introduction&nbsp;at the Agora on August 9, 1978, tells you everything you need to know: “There was this kind of music not widely known but it was called Fraternity Rock —&nbsp;and you don’t know what that is. Now Fraternity Rock, that was like ‘Louie Louie,’ that was like ‘Farmer John’ by the Premiers, that was a song by the Swingin’ Medallions called ‘Double Shot of My Baby’s Love’ — no hits up here, right. Anyway, the big, the big thing that these records had, you see, was that on it the audience was at least twice as loud as the band. […]&nbsp;I think you got the idea! So when Clarence holds up the ‘applause’ signs —&nbsp;no, I mean when you feel it! When it moves you! This is called ‘Sherry Darling.’ It should’ve been a single, it should’ve been released in the summertime.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-246-0-0@published data-word-count=74><strong>71. <a href=#>“Light of Day,” MTV Plugged</a>.</strong> This particular version of “Light of Day” does everything it can to ruin what it means to be a barnburner. Springsteen’s vocals are about the only good thing of note. (And this isn’t blind hatred of the ‘92 band, just this exact performance.) It ranks as high as it does for two reasons: the power of the actual song, and how it absolutely improves any concert set list.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-247-0-0@published data-word-count=136><strong>70. <a href=#>“Wreck on the Highway,” The River</a>.</strong> Springsteen openly admitted that he stole the title of this song from Roy Acuff, but he liberally borrowed other elements from country music as well: the melody, the organ riff, and the stark brutality of the story. “On a rainy highway the character witnesses a fatal accident. He drives home, and lying awake that night next to his lover, he realizes you have a limited number of opportunities to love someone, to do your work, to be a part of something, to parent your children, to do something good,” he writes in Songs. It’s the last track of The River, and after the vocals conclude, Springsteen uses an extended instrumental outro for the entire final minute. After such an intense, emotional experience, the listener needs to breathe and recover.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-248-0-0@published data-word-count=46><strong>69. <a href=#>“Highway Patrolman,” Nebraska</a>.</strong> An unflinching portrait about hard choices, family ties, and our essential humanity. I thought a lot about this song’s unabashed sympathy for its characters around the time a Fraternal Order of Police leader called Bruce a “<a href=#>floating fag</a>” for writing “American Skin.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-249-0-0@published data-word-count=108><strong>68. <a href=#>“My Father’s House,” Nebraska</a>.</strong> This one hits you right in the gut. You don’t exactly know what’s going on, what inspired the longing and the fear in the song’s lyrics. In 1990, Springsteen <a href=#>offered an unexpected explanation</a>: He used to drive by one of his childhood houses all the time, and when he started seeing a therapist, he asked why he was doing it. The therapist explained, “You’re going back thinking you can make it right again. Something went wrong, and you keep going back to see if you can fix it.” Springsteen replied, “That is what I’m doing.” And the therapist told him, “Well, you can’t.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-250-0-0@published data-word-count=120><strong>67. <a href=#>“Real World,” Human Touch</a>.</strong> Co-written with Bittan, this song remains phenomenal despite suffering from the worst of ‘90s production values. There’s a random clanging doorbell on the eighth downbeat, what sounds like the cheapest Casio keyboard mucking up the melody, and the pace is entirely too rushed. But Springsteen’s vocal delivery is straight and powerful, while the lyrics stand with some of his best work. Alongside “Human Touch,” it’s a moving and honest continuation of his post–Tunnel of Love emotional state. Plus, a decent guitar solo covers up the worst of the production garbage. “Real World” ultimately triumphs as <a href=#>a solo piano performance</a>, and I’m sure there’s a version with the full band that’s just dying to come out.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-251-0-0@published data-word-count=83><strong>66. <a href=#>“Seeds,” Live 1975–1985</a>.</strong> The most underrated of Springsteen’s overtly political songs, “Seeds” is a new riff on The Grapes of Wrath, the story of a hopeful family that tries to follow the oil boom to Texas and comes up empty-handed. It’s bitter, precise, and brutal, with the music to match. Bruce spits out the words, while Nils Lofgren strums big, melodic chords. This one still comes out on tours when he wants to make a particular point, but nowhere near often enough.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-252-0-0@published data-word-count=99><strong>65. <a href=#>“Night,” Born to Run</a>.</strong> It doesn’t matter if you never worked a blue-collar day in your life, there is no way you cannot identify with “Night.” The melody is the sound of the night itself, that time when you’re only accountable to yourself, when you can be whomever you want: “You work nine to five and somehow you survive till the night.” The song has mystery and madness and love —&nbsp;there’s always a girl — as Bruce takes you with him through the rat traps and the soul crusaders and the chromed invaders. You can’t help but believe.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-253-0-0@published data-word-count=73><strong>64. <a href=#>“I’m Goin’ Down,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> This is the dark horse of the record, which is a pity. “I’m Goin’ Down” is another one of those tracks that balances a bouncy, almost-rockabilly tune with darker lyrics. It’s a story about a relationship on the verge of deterioration, wrapped up in a three-and-a-half minute pop song. It isn’t performed often, but it’s an awful lot of fun when it does show up.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-254-0-0@published data-word-count=187><strong>63. <a href=#>“Blood Brothers,” Greatest Hits</a>.</strong> Springsteen wrote this song “on the eve of recording with the E Street Band again,” just before they went into the studio to record bonus tracks for Greatest Hits in 1995. A bit surprisingly, this ode to E Street isn’t a hard-driving anthem about the redemptive power of rock and roll. It’s a quiet, gently lilting, contemplative number that’s full of hesitancy and uncertainty. “Blood Brothers” makes no attempt to revise history. “We were women and men,” reminds us that Patti Scialfa wasn’t simply an E Street auxiliary, and there’s brave ambivalence in that last verse: “I don’t know why I made this call/or if any of this matters anymore after all.” It’s been played live (for paying audiences) exactly three times: the last show of the Reunion tour, the last show of the Rising tour, and to open the set in the second show after Federici’s passing, in 2008. There’s also an alternate version on the Blood Brothers EP, which is the diametric opposite of this one. It sounds more modern, with an almost Gaelic atonal chanting of the first verse.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-255-0-0@published data-word-count=121><strong>62. <a href=#>“County Fair,” The Essential Bruce Springsteen</a>.</strong> With some of Springsteen’s outtakes, the hype is less about the quality than elusiveness … and then there are the others, which absolutely earn it. “County Fair” belongs in the latter class. Springsteen creates an entire world in less than five minutes. It’s all there, from the crickets in the intro and the AM-radio crackle of the recording to the soft heat of a summer evening in the tone of his voice. Take note of the crafted, elegant detail: the banner across Main Street, the stuffed bears, James Young and the Immortal Ones,&nbsp;“just two guitars, baby, bass and drums.” Sadly, this Born in the U.S.A. outtake just didn’t fit the vision of the album.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-256-0-0@published data-word-count=108><strong>61. <a href=#>“Open All Night,” Nebraska</a>.</strong> “In which the hero braves snow, sleet, rain, and the highway patrol for a kiss from his baby’s lips,” Springsteen noted when he sent the original Nebraska demos to Landau. “Open All Night” is the soundtrack of driving the New Jersey Turnpike in the middle of the night, radio relay towers glowing red in the distance. The unadorned version of the song absolutely cooks, but Springsteen has struggled with the live rendition over the years, most recently tarting it up in an over-the-top big-band rendition, completely unnecessary for a song with the key lyric, “Hey ho, rock and roll, deliver me from nowhere.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-257-0-0@published data-word-count=122><strong>60. <a href=#>“The E Street Shuffle,” The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle</a>.</strong> The cacophony of the opening brass and the funk of the chicken-scratch guitar send a clear message:&nbsp;The E Street Band has arrived. The tales are sharper, the details more specific, the scenarios a little less fanciful, the music tighter, and Springsteen’s vocals more controlled. It’s a microcosm of the elements that would mark his best compositions from now until forever: horn lines, rock-solid bass lines, party noises, and a key lyric for crowd response. (“Everybody form a line.”) When “Shuffle” shows up on a set list, the instrumental outro with horns, percussion, bass, and guitar can still push the E Street Band to the top of their game.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-258-0-0@published data-word-count=129><strong>59. <a href=#>“Bobby Jean,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> “‘Bobby Jean’ was a good song about youthful friendship,” is as far as Springsteen goes in Songs. You can’t really blame him for being vague. The beauty of the song is its universality —&nbsp;there’s a reason the name in the title is ambiguous —&nbsp;because everyone can identify with early friendships that must inevitably change. Of course, the last verse seems like it was inspired by Van Zandt’s 1983 announcement that he’d be leaving the E Street Band, but it could very well be about anyone you know, anyone who hits the road to find what they need. The absolute highlight of the track is Clemons’s heartrending solo, warm and rich against the backdrop of the lyrical, repetitive melody. <a href=#>Buon viaggio, mio fratello.</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-259-0-0@published data-word-count=150><strong>58. <a href=#>“Candy’s Room,” Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.</strong> “Candy’s Room” is often a precursor to “She’s the One” during live shows, since they’re similar tales of naked lust and desire. But “Candy’s Room” is more about taking action —&nbsp;he’s going to walk the darkness of Candy’s hall —&nbsp;and the music conveys that theme brilliantly. Weinberg rides the hi-hat on the intro, and Springsteen quietly delivers the opening lines before gets to the good stuff, before he tells us what it’s like being with Candy. The drum roll is fast-paced until the entire band comes in on the midpoint, and then once again before they break for the guitar solo, so elegant and full of tension. Bittan comes in at the end to heighten the song’s energy, and then the drums return, pushing forward until that very last note, crashing the cymbals as the guitar notes soar into the distance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-260-0-0@published data-word-count=45><strong>57. <a href=#>“The Ties That Bind,” The River</a>.</strong> Want to know why the first version of The River was called The Ties That Bind? This song is album’s mission statement. True to its name, it’s a brisk, hopeful rocker with a clear and unadorned vocal delivery.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-261-0-0@published data-word-count=103><strong>56. <a href=#>“Reason to Believe,” Nebraska</a>.</strong> “Reason to Believe” is song about blind faith and dogged belief. I always appreciated the balance of its construction: In the second verse, Johnny walks out on Mary Lou; in the fourth verse, a man gets stood up at the altar, subverting expectations. When Springsteen sent the demos to Jon Landau, he noted that the song was “culled from my own experience driving down Highway 33 on my way to Millstone.” It’s fascinating to consider how a dude poking a dead dog with a stick on the side of the road could result in this (or any) song.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-262-0-0@published data-word-count=71><strong>55. <a href=#>“Take ‘Em As They Come,” Tracks</a>.</strong> This River outtake is one of the great lost Springsteen songs. It’s another dark tale paired against a bright, classic pop melody with aching vocals. (Bruce sings his own counterpoint coming out of the left channel.) At the end, the song kicks into another instrumental refrain, with Weinberg driving the beat for a few seconds before a melody swings back for the true reprise.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-263-0-0@published data-word-count=75><strong>54. <a href=#>“Streets of Fire,” Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.</strong> A deliberately overwrought song. All of the restraint exercised on the rest of Darkness is abandoned in “Streets on Fire” because the main character has stopped fighting fate. Springsteen toggles convincingly between world-weary and strung-out before blasting unrestrained into the choruses. Federici backs all of this with solemn, churchlike chords, and the whole band comes in swinging. Bonus points for the tightly wound guitar solo.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-264-0-0@published data-word-count=142><strong>53. <a href=#>“Rocky Ground,” Wrecking Ball</a>.</strong> The most interesting, forward-thinking, experimental song of the post-reunion era. And somehow, it still has bona fide ties to everything that came before it. It’s not surprising that Springsteen would want to experiment with loops and mechanical beats to see how they could be applied to his creative process. It’s not surprising that the man who wrote “madman drummer bummers like Indians in the summer” would try his hand at rapping after all those years of listening to it. (Even though he ultimately asked Michelle Moore to <a href=#>handle the rap verse</a>.) And after a few attempts to work with traditional gospel constructs, it’s not surprising he’d try to write something more contemporary. “Rocky Ground” is undeniably fresh, inspirational, and uplifting. It soothes your heart and uplifts your spirit, which is exactly what gospel is supposed to do.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-265-0-0@published data-word-count=123><strong>52. <a href=#>“Johnny 99,” Nebraska</a>.</strong> Nebraska pulls so much straight from folk music, but more than any of the other tracks on the record, “Johnny 99” has an aching, timeless feel to it. If you swapped out the references, this could be any tale of a man falling afoul of the law, getting trapped by his own mistakes. You can easily imagine hearing it next to a campfire, sung by a lone cowboy roaming the Plains with a guitar strapped across his back. Springsteen played it solo acoustic in the Enormo-domes on the Born in the U.S.A. tour, but it’s maddening that modern versions have run the gamut from zydeco to an exaggerated countrylike melody, all of which does the composition a grave disservice.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-266-0-0@published data-word-count=222><strong>51. <a href=#>“Kitty’s Back,” The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle</a>.</strong> There’s a reason why this song was performed when the E Street Band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The horns are hot from the first note, the guitar intro is already on fire. The gauntlet is immediately thrown down. “Kitty’s Back” is a seven-minute, free-jazz exploration: Springsteen scat singing, the baritone sax holding the line, the other brass and the guitar playing the melody. Sancious’s keyboards are languid, and this is Vini Lopez’s best percussion work. When performed live, though, the song becomes something else. That’s when it lets its hair down, when it soars, when it becomes a fleeting, totally unique experience. Federici was in his element in those moments, playing with an energy and a deftness that broadcasted his instinctive, deep-seated feel for the music. Whenever Bruce would let “Kitty’s Back” out on a long leash in concert, he would shout and nod and pump his fist while Bittan and Danny played it back and forth. The fans snapped their fingers and sang back, “Here she comes, here she comes,” before Bruce and the band explode: “Kitty’s back in town!” And then, right after the final coda hit — “Oooooh, all right, all right” — the horns sneak in for one last gasp.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-267-0-0@published data-word-count=166><strong>50. <a href=#>“Long Walk Home,” Magic</a>.</strong> Without a doubt, this is one of the best and most important songs Springsteen wrote in the ‘00s. “Long Walk Home” is about the framework of the country ceasing to support the people who built it. He’s pointing out the cracks in the foundation, stating unequivocally that the situation is unacceptable. The lyrics are concise and precise; the images evocative and heartrending. It’s almost cinematic. This isn’t a song where the music and the lyrics are deliberately at odds. The E Street Band are sounding the goddamn alarm, telling you to wake up and pay attention. The guitars are a combustion engine, driving the energy up and pushing the song forward. The most breathtaking moment is the handoff to the sax solo, both at the bridge and the end: Bruce stops soloing under the rhythm line, and after just a breath, Clarence comes in for his solo, picking up the baton like he and Bruce are a pair of relay runners.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-268-0-0@published data-word-count=47><strong>49. <a href=#>“Cadillac Ranch,” The River</a>.</strong> Few songs capture the buoyant, loose fun of the E Street Band better than “Cadillac Ranch.” This one got its title from <a href=#>a renegade art installation just outside of Amarillo, Texas</a>, which consists of ten vintage Cadillacs buried nose-first into a cornfield.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-269-0-0@published data-word-count=54><strong>48. <a href=#>“Spirit in the Night,” Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</a></strong> Springsteen abandons the rhyming dictionary to tell a story about Wild Billy, G-Man, Hazy Davy, and Killer Joe on a soft summer night, lightning bugs flickering in the distance. And if that’s not enough, it’s lit up by an elegant, soft solo from Clemons.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-270-0-0@published data-word-count=66><strong>47. <a href=#>“Drive All Night,” The River</a>.</strong> It’s slow-dance time. “Drive All Night” is a straight soul crooner, a chance for Springsteen to live out his Sam Cooke fantasies. He’s lost his love, but there’s still hope: “I swear I’d drive all night again/Just to buy you some shoes,” Bruce sings, breathless and utterly believable. Clemons’s sax solo represents the aural embodiment of that bright, soaring hope.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-271-0-0@published data-word-count=125><strong>46. <a href=#>“4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy),” The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle</a>.</strong> For so many diehard fans —&nbsp;the ones who make pilgrimages to the Jersey Shore so they can stand on the boardwalk and pose for photographs next to Madam Marie’s — this song is sacred ground. Even non-fans who grew up hearing “Asbury Park” on FM radio will smile wistfully when it’s played. Still, one has to wonder if this song would be as important if it didn’t have the words “Asbury Park” in the title. There are better boardwalk songs, better beach songs, and better tales of Shore legends. (Just look one spot above, at “Growin’ Up.”) Bonus points for Federici’s accordion, which embodies the sounds of the Shore.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-272-0-0@published data-word-count=52><strong>45. <a href=#>“Growin’ Up,” Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.</a></strong> The best song on the first record. “Growin’ Up” has the tightest structure, the most self-aware humor, the most sophistication, and the strongest songwriting. It runs the emotional gamut from caution to the balls-out confidence of “When they said sit down, I stood up.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-273-0-0@published data-word-count=68><strong>44. <a href=#>“My Hometown,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> For all of Springsteen’s songs about his native state, this one reveals more about life on the Jersey Shore than any of the tales that preceded it. Bruce writes eloquently about his relationship with his father, the race riots in Asbury Park, the economic aftermath of white flight, and its ensuing impact on his generation, his neighbors, and his titular hometown.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-274-0-0@published data-word-count=39><strong>43. <a href=#>“Glory Days,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> People love this number for its old-timey singalong style, the repetition of the organ chords, and its general celebration of drinking, beer, and baseball. But it’s a fastball, Bruce, not a speedball.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-275-0-0@published data-word-count=83><strong>42. <a href=#>“Roulette,” Tracks</a>.</strong> Directly inspired by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, “Roulette” is instantly fraught and tense. Springsteen cuts right to the heart of the action in the first line: “We left the toys out in the yard.” It’s like a camera zooming into tight focus. On The River documentary, Bruce admits it was a mistake to leave this song off the album. It was literally the first song recorded in those sessions; it should have replaced “Jackson Cage” in a heartbeat.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-276-0-0@published data-word-count=44><strong>41. <a href=#>“My Love Will Not Let You Down,” Tracks</a>.</strong> A passionate anthem about love, loyalty, and commitment that’s just as much a promise from Springsteen to his audience. When this song shows up in a set list, it’s going to be a great night.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-277-0-0@published data-word-count=142><strong>40. <a href=#>“Independence Day,” The River</a>.</strong> For years, Springsteen told stories on tour about his relationship with his father, whether to preface covers like the Animals’ “It’s My Life,” or originals like “Growin’ Up,” “Factory,” and “Rosalita.” A typical recitation from the ‘78 tour was something like: “My father used to sit in the kitchen …&nbsp;but I’d never get through the kitchen without an argument, you know, we’d always have an argument, no matter what time I came in.” All of those stories were buildup to the story Bruce was finally ready to tell when he got to The River. The art of “Independence Day” lies in its direct simplicity: The lyrics are the focal point, accompanied by a light melody. There’s a measured equanimity to the vocals that matches the tone of those lyrics, rousing yet another one of those heartrending moments.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-278-0-0@published data-word-count=51><strong>39. <a href=#>“Fade Away,” The River</a>.</strong> One of The River’s tours de force, this compelling ballad is driven by 12-string acoustic, Federici’s heartrending organ melodies, and Bittan anchoring things on the other side. Springsteen delivers a perfectly pitched vocal, full of anguish and longing, while Van Zandt adds harmonies in the chorus.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-279-0-0@published data-word-count=133><strong>38. <a href=#>“Human Touch,” Human Touch</a>.</strong> After the emotional chaos that was Tunnel of Love, “Human Touch” is about what happened when Springsteen climbed out of the wreckage. It’s a frank and hopeful assessment of what he hoped would happen next. “We’re all riders on this train” is one of his most important lines — it’s straight from gospel, from the blues, from Elvis. He’ll keep coming back to that metaphor. The live version is phenomenal, trading an overabundance of ‘90s synth-cheese for loud guitars. The song has a more urgent pace, and the final solo is fervent and direct. If you only like Springsteen because he reminds you of your misspent youth, you’ll write off “Human Touch,” but if you’re interested in who he became as he grew up, you can’t skip this.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-280-0-0@published data-word-count=134><strong>37. <a href=#>“No Surrender,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> Van Zandt didn’t always win his disagreements with Springsteen, but we all benefitted when his opinion prevailed. “No Surrender” is one of those victories. Springsteen wasn’t going to include the song on Born in the U.S.A. — “It was a song I was uncomfortable with,” he writes in Songs, “You don’t hold out and triumph all the time in life.” —&nbsp;until Van Zandt talked him into adding it. Why? “The portrait of friendship and the song’s expression of the inspirational power of rock music was an important part of the picture.” The song sounds less dated than many of its contemporaries, in no small part because “We learned more from a three-minute record, baby, than we ever learned in school” is a line that will always resonate.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-281-0-0@published data-word-count=28><strong>36. <a href=#>“The Rising,” The Rising</a>.</strong> Majestic and profound, “The Rising” is truly a modern classic. The song has swung from tribute to triumph to remembrance, and powerfully so.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-282-0-0@published data-word-count=197><strong>35. <a href=#>“My City of Ruins,” The Rising</a>.</strong> Inspired by the decay of his adopted hometown, Springsteen’s first true gospel song is a stunning piece of work. “My City of Ruins” debuted at <a href=#>a series of Christmas benefit concerts held in the Asbury Park Convention Hall in 2000</a>. It’s incredibly significant that Springsteen chose to use an African-American musical form to commemorate Asbury Park, a locale which has such a terrible history with regard to race relations.&nbsp;(You can see physical scars today, if you drive up Springwood Avenue past the train station. The empty lots and boarded-up windows are still there.) A great song like this one can transcend its original meaning, too. When Springsteen chose to perform this song for America: A Tribute to Heroes, it was presented with <a href=#>quiet solemnity</a>. At the first Jazzfest after Hurricane Katrina, it was about <a href=#>anger and survival</a>. During the first E Street Band tour after the Clemons’s death, it was the moment when Bruce announced the band’s “roll call,” which culminated with, “Are we missing anybody? Are we missing anybody?” as spotlights hit an empty organ (for Federici, who died in 2008) and the Big Man’s empty spot on stage-right.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-283-0-0@published data-word-count=272><strong>34. <a href=#>“State Trooper,” Nebraska</a>.</strong> “It’s kinda weird,” is how Springsteen described “State Trooper” when he sent his bedroom cassette to manager Jon Landau. Bruce recorded Nebraska at home because he’d been frustrated by previous recording studio experiences: “I decided I needed a way to find a way to hear my songs before I brought them into the studio,” he explains in Songs. So he sent out his guitar tech to pick up a four-track tape machine, set it up in his bedroom, and recorded a series of demos. Would “State Trooper” have emerged from a traditional studio setting? Probably not. Springsteen would have overthought it. The songs that ended up on Nebraska were inspired by the dark nights of the soul that came out of his exploration of country music, film noir, Southern Gothic, and The Executioner’s Song. In other words,&nbsp;tales in which people completely lose their way. The song’s most striking element is not the eerie howls at the end, but the hypnotic rhythm, borrowed straight out of “Mystery Train.” It’s the sound of blood pounding in your temples. “State Trooper” doesn’t need those howls to make you feel like you’re on the edge of the world. And, of course, it has so many parallels to Suicide’s “<a href=#>Frankie Teardrop</a>.” Springsteen and Suicide vocalist Alan Vega met when they both worked at the Power Station in the ‘80s, drinking vodka in the bathroom and chewing the proverbial fat. When I interviewed Vega in 2005, I asked him what he thought when he first heard this song. His response? “Good for him, that he listened to me and managed to make it commercial!”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-284-0-0@published data-word-count=127><strong>33. <a href=#>“Adam Raised a Cain,” Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.</strong> Springsteen’s Catholic-school upbringing usually manifests itself in the women he writes about —&nbsp;there’s a reason almost everyone is “Mary” or “Maria” —&nbsp;but here he turns to the classic biblical metaphor of internecine jealousy to explore a relationship between fathers and sons. He needed a device to hide behind, though. He wasn’t quite ready to write about his own father. It’s an intense song, driven and heated, with the best moment coming on that last refrain, where Springsteen deliberately hops off the rhythm for a beat, just to demonstrate how he’s absolutely in control of his performance. The E Street Band aren’t just a quaint throwback on backing vocals, either; they underscore the song’s deliberately masculine atmosphere.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-285-0-0@published data-word-count=108><strong>32. <a href=#>“Because the Night,” Live 1975–85</a>.</strong> This particular entry is tough. The track is undoubtedly high in the canon, but Springsteen never recorded a decent studio version. (The one on The Promise is turgid at best.) I hate being one of those “Oh, you shoulda heard it in ‘78” people, but in this case it happens to be accurate. The officially released version on Live 1975–85 is less about heat and more about athleticism. Those ‘78 versions pulse and shimmer with lust, which is the whole goddamn point of the song.&nbsp;Try the ones from the Roxy, the September 21 show in Passaic, or the official Cleveland Agora bootleg.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-286-0-0@published data-word-count=64><strong>31. <a href=#>“The Price You Pay,” The River</a>.</strong> Springsteen issues an immediate challenge in the first line: “You make up your mind, you choose the chance you take.” Another track that harkens to the country music he immersed himself in during this period, “The Price You Pay” has a regal, gently loping syncopation, driven by the interplay between piano and 12-string electric. It is magnificent.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-287-0-0@published data-word-count=77><strong>30. <a href=#>“Dancing in the Dark,” Born in the U.S.A.</a></strong> This is a phenomenal pop song. The melody is light and catchy, there’s wonderful energy in Springsteen’s vocal delivery, the E Street Band’s rhythm section is on point, and Clemons gifts the track with a lovely sax solo at the fadeout. Yes, sure, fine: It’s got ‘80s production, compression, and abundance of synthesizer. That doesn’t matter. The bones of “Dancing in the Dark” are solid as all get-out.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-288-0-0@published data-word-count=259><b>29. <a href=#>“Land of Hope and Dreams,” <i>Wrecking Ball</i></a>.</b> When Springsteen got the band back together for the reunion concerts in 1999 and 2000, they played this song at the end of the set. “Land of Hope and Dreams” ties together everything that came before it —&nbsp;everything that had happened, both onstage and off-, in the years since the band started playing and the audience started showing up. It was a brand-new song at the time, and Springsteen went all the way back to the roots of rock and roll with it. The metaphoric train comes straight out of gospel: There’s a direct line between<a href=#> Sister Rosetta Tharpe’s “This Train</a>,” Elvis’s “Mystery Train,” Curtis Mayfield’s “People Get Ready” and, well, this train. Sister Tharpe tells you right off that “this train is a clean train,” but Bruce is having none of that; his train is big enough for saints, sinners, losers and winners. He’s giving an updated version of “Nobody wins unless everybody wins.” Still, it is like gospel because it fills your heart, lifts you up, and gives you hope. The studio version on <i>Wrecking Ball</i> captures the best parts of all of the versions: It has more complexity than the original Live in New York City rendition, more texture, and more space for the lyrics and the melody. It’s more of a composition than a straight rock and roll song. Docked a few points because Springsteen’s vocals feel too thin, though it gains them back for using a sax solo played by Clemons, who always deserves the moment.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-289-0-0@published data-word-count=117><strong>28. <a href=#>“Point Blank,” The River</a>.</strong> The influence of film (especially American noir) on Springsteen’s writing comes to the forefront in “Point Blank.” The title is evocative, the music full of pathos and mystery, the vocals delivered with an initial detachment that’s clearly at odds with the first-person narrative. Bittan is the MVP once again, delivering a calm and measured performance. Federici slides in on the second verse with another brilliant layer of coloration, which expands the depth of focus, before he takes that smooth, dark solo at the end of the verse. And who could forget that dissonant, deliberately jarring melody line on guitar during the choruses? Or that steady chime of the triangle in the background?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-290-0-0@published data-word-count=125><strong>27. <a href=#>“Incident on 57th Street,” The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle</a>.</strong> The grandest of Springsteen’s romances, “Incident on 57th Street” is the saga of Spanish Johnny and Puerto Rican Jane. It’s Romeo and Juliet. It’s West Side Story. It’s remarkably lush, dominated by Sancious’s piano and Federici’s organ, as Springsteen carefully walks us through the action: “Oh, good night, it’s all right, Jane, I’ll meet you tomorrow night on Lover’s Lane,” he sings. “We may find it out on the street tonight, baby.” The band crescendos up and up, carrying the lovers into the sunset, a small but tasteful guitar solo fading into the most delicate sprinkling of piano notes. And then, “Rosalita.” Few transitions are so unexpected, so joyful, so life-affirming.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-291-0-0@published data-word-count=87><strong>26. <a href=#>“Hungry Heart,” The River</a>.</strong> A terrific, expansive pop single in the tradition of the Brill Building. Springsteen wrote “Hungry Heart” after a night hanging out with the Ramones at the Fast Lane in Asbury Park, and luckily thought to mention this to Jon Landau before sending it over to them. Yes, the recording was sped up ever so slightly to make the track radio-friendly, which clearly worked —&nbsp;it was Springsteen’s first top-ten single, making it to as high as number five on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-292-0-0@published data-word-count=47><strong>25. <a href=#>“Stolen Car,” The River</a>.</strong> A breathtaking and wretched song, but absolutely gorgeous from a production and composition standpoint. “Stolen Car” is&nbsp;delicate and simple, with drama created from a minimal melody performed on piano and timpani (or Max Weinberg using mallets, at least), plus Springsteen’s straight-ahead vocals.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-293-0-0@published data-word-count=89><strong>24. <a href=#>“She’s the One,” Born to Run</a>.</strong> “She’s the One” is liquid lust. Bruce puts on the Roy Orbison voice for all that he’s worth, and then there’s that rhythm, blatantly lifted straight from Bo Diddley’s “Mona.” The rhythm section generates deep, dark blues, matched against the delicate layers of keyboards. (Bittan more than earns his “Professor” title with this track.) The last 30 seconds of rhythm, bass, and honky-tonk piano is almost the best part. It’s the E Street Band in lockstep, operating seamlessly as a single organism.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-294-0-0@published data-word-count=133><strong>23. <a href=#>“Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,” Born to Run</a>.</strong> The intro riff —&nbsp;the horns followed by a roll on the snare —&nbsp;is one of the crispest, most classic, most Springsteenian intros ever. The studio recording of “Tenth Avenue” marks the moment when Steve Van Zandt was put on the E Street payroll, <a href=#>when he stepped up and sang the horn charts to the Brecker Brothers</a>. More important, the song is the origin story of Bad Scooter and the Big Man: “I want to tell you the story about the band,” is how Bruce would introduce it in 2009. It is the first song <a href=#>they played at the Super Bowl</a>. It became the moment of tribute for the Big Man after his passing. It is the legend of E Street, and that is no small thing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-295-0-0@published data-word-count=58><strong>22. <a href=#>“American Skin (41 Shots),” High Hopes</a>.</strong> A stunning, remarkable, impossibly tragic song. “American Skin” is yet another misunderstood composition —&nbsp;in this case, whenever it’s criticized as <a href=#>a condemnation of police officers</a>. The album cannot possibly capture those moments, when you’re standing in an arena or a stadium, wondering if it’s being performed in response to something else.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-296-0-0@published data-word-count=78><strong>21. <a href=#>“Tougher Than the Rest,” Tunnel of Love</a>.</strong> Proof that Springsteen’s grown-up love songs are as brilliantly hopeful as the ones he wrote ten years earlier. “Tougher Than the Rest” is a touching sentiment, covered in too much synthesizer, but it’s worth it for every second of warmth and vulnerability in his voice. These days, Bruce plays this song when Patti’s back on the tour, or just when she’s there. It’s about the hope in that connection, too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-297-0-0@published data-word-count=96><b>20. <a href=#>“Brilliant Disguise,” <i>Tunnel of Love</i></a>.</b> Springsteen wrote an entire album about the empty spaces in his marriage without realizing it until he was done. This is part of what sent him into therapy —&nbsp;and I’m not telling tales here. He’s been <a href=#>talking about it</a> since 1990. But subconscious or not, what a song. The guitar dominates the synthesizers, while Bruce’s voice is flecked with that country-flavored Orbisonian pathos. (Is that a word? It should be.) “I wanna know if it’s you I don’t trust/’Cause I damn sure don’t trust myself” is heartrending every single time.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-298-0-0@published data-word-count=131><b>19. <a href=#>“The Promise,” <i>18 Tracks</i></a>.</b> “I don’t write songs about lawsuits,” Springsteen once said, when someone asked why he never played “The Promise” any more. He’s not being totally sincere, though. The song isn’t about the lawsuit; it’s about the fear Bruce felt in the middle of his chest when he realized that someone could stop him from doing the only thing he knew how to do. The performance is naked and unvarnished, just him and the piano, singing from that place next to his heart. The alternate version that surfaced on 2010’s <i>The Promise</i> is different. It’s no longer about Springsteen. It’s about someone else, another character, drawn from the people he saw on the Circuit. The instrumentation leans toward country rock, and the vocals are louder and more confident.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-299-0-0@published data-word-count=117><strong>18. <a href=#>“Prove It All Night,” Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.</strong> “Prove It All Night” is a call to action. The hidden gems aren’t what you would expect: Federici’s gently rolling organ buried in the mix, Bittan’s precise piano chords, Weinberg mixing a simple 1-2 rhythm with the occasional tiny flourish. We’ll forgive the impressionistic liberties taken in Springsteen’s lyrics, if only for the song’s satisfying classic-rock dynamic. I’ve long wondered why he wants her to put her hair back in a long white bow to meet him in the field behind the dynamo.&nbsp;Is it to make sure he recognizes her? How many people are out there in that field? And what, pray tell, is a dynamo?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-300-0-0@published data-word-count=96><b>17. <a href=#>“Darkness on the Edge of Town,” <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i></a>.</b> Two things elevate this track: the intensity of Springsteen’s vocal delivery, and the range of emotion from the verses to the choruses. It’s not just anger — it’s frustration and resignation. The verses are quietly matter of fact, but the choruses explode with depth and emotion. The E Street Band is on top of their game: Federici’s organ sneaks into the corners, while Bittan’s piano meanders with purpose through the choruses. If you listen carefully enough, you’ll even hear Clarence Clemons on triangle.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-301-0-0@published data-word-count=139><b>16. <a href=#>“Tunnel of Love,” <i>Tunnel of Love</i></a>.</b> “Tunnel of Love” is stuffed with so much fear, sorrow, and confusion. There’s genius and artistry in the song’s construction: the introduction mimicking the sounds of the carnival fairway, the first verse on a neutral instrumentation, the action pick-up in the second verse. The tension in Springsteen’s vocals increases from verse to verse, his voice breaking ever so slightly on the last one, fully aware of the heartbreak that’s sure to follow. And all throughout, the music swirls around you like a Tilt-A-Whirl. What’s amazing about “Tunnel of Love” is how the sentiment hasn’t aged. It doesn’t seem overwrought or foolish; it still cuts you straight through the heart. Bonus points to<a href=#> the version from the 1988 tour with the Horns of Love</a>, tingeing the song with that much more bittersweet flavor.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-302-0-0@published data-word-count=86><strong>15. <a href=#>“The Ghost of Tom Joad,” The Ghost of Tom Joad</a>.</strong> Springsteen sings with a quiet, solemn conviction that makes you feel like he’s telling a story he saw with his own eyes. It’s written like a movie, each verse cutting to another scene: current events, snapshots of the past, and parts that could be a mixture of both. The electric version that Springsteen recorded with Tom Morello for High Hopes maintains the core elements of majesty and solemnity from the original, turned up to 11.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-303-0-0@published data-word-count=64><strong>14. <a href=#>“Streets of Philadelphia,” Greatest Hits</a>.</strong> Let’s hear it for one of Springsteen’s greatest opening lines: “I was bruised and battered/I couldn’t tell what I felt.” Over a solemn, measured backbeat and minimal melody, he relays this tremendously poignant story, choosing just the right elements to work into the song. “Streets of Philadelphia” won the 1994 Oscar for Best Original Song, and deservedly so.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-304-0-0@published data-word-count=119><strong>13. <a href=#>“New York City Serenade,” The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle</a>.</strong> The dramatic piano chords that open “New York City Serenade” deliberately make a statement and set a tone before drifting off into the gentle, lilting melody of the song’s body. It grabs your heart, squeezes, and doesn’t let go. “Serenade” is almost ten minutes of grandeur and desire. It’s one of the best songs about New York City, but it’s also a song that could have only been written by someone who wasn’t from there, for whom the city was life and escape and hope. When the strings soar, your spirit sings. “So walk tall or baby don’t walk at all.” Words to live by.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-305-0-0@published data-word-count=186><strong>12. <a href=#>“Rosalita (Come Out Tonight),” The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle</a>.</strong> “Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)” is the most legendary of Springsteen set closers and encores, the ultimate Jersey Shore legend. It is chaos and escape and freedom and defiance and revolution. The E Street Band fire on all cylinders here, and Springsteen is at his beach-beatnik best as he issues the challenge to Rosie: “I ain’t here on business, I’m only here for fun,” and “Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor, closets are for hangers, winners use the door!” Clemons’s sax is the glue holding the story together, carrying us from verse to verse, while the rest of the band surges and drops back in turn, that unmistakeable mélange&nbsp;of bass and organ and piano carrying Bruce to the edge. Springsteen wrote about “Rosalita” in Songs, noting that the line “Someday we’ll look back on this and it will all seem funny” was “a peek into the future …&nbsp;not that it would all BE funny, but that it would all SEEM funny. Probably one of the most useful lines I’ve ever written.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-306-0-0@published data-word-count=68><strong>11. <a href=#>“This Hard Land,” Greatest Hits</a>.</strong> One of the most unknown, underrated songs in the non-diehard catalogue. “This Hard Land” is absolutely sublime, a rollicking tale of friendship and loyalty, delivered with a classic country-rock melody. The first time you hear it, the song feels old and familiar. Bruce’s voice is warm and affectionate and Bittan’s work is Coplandesque, rolling and grand, as expansive as the Great Plains.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-307-0-0@published data-word-count=84><strong>10. <a href=#>“Atlantic City,” Nebraska</a>.</strong> “Atlantic City” immediately drags you to the action: “Well, they blew up the Chicken Man in Philly last night.” Boom! You’re there. The fading glory and distant memories of Atlantic City are right in Springsteen’s wheelhouse, and he knocked this one out of the park. “I wanted the music to feel like a waking dream and the record to move like poetry,” he wrote of Nebraska in Songs. He absolutely succeeded. Bonus points for <a href=#>the best video he ever made</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-308-0-0@published data-word-count=146><strong>9. <a href=#>“The River,” The River</a>.</strong> There are so many reasons why this is one of Springsteen’s best compositions. The title seems so simple and direct,&nbsp;except that the nature of the river changes from verse to verse. It’s a device of escape, of purification, of redemption, of solace. The first time I heard this song in Europe, the rapt applause made me remember that this is a story as old as time, as old as dirt, as old as humankind. It was an awe-inspiring, unifying moment. Instrumentally, the track is unparalleled. The harmonica opens the track, keening like a train whistle high in the distance. It’s accompanied by an elegant 12-string guitar, the dueling melodies on organ and piano, and the barely controlled emotion lurking behind Springsteen’s voice. The fact that he based “The River” on his sister’s life is actually the least interesting thing about it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-309-0-0@published data-word-count=203><strong>8. <a href=#>“Racing in the Street,” Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.</strong> The depth of the sadness contained in “Racing in the Street” can be utterly overwhelming. It’s there from the first note, when Bittan’s solemn chords set the tone before Springsteen begins to sing, his voice tinged with reminiscence, regret, and resignation. The song gradually builds: just piano and vocals in the first verse and first chorus, then the E Street Band steps in, one at a time, slowly raising the emotional tension. Weinberg hitting the stick against the edge of the snare, then Federici hitting a handful of organ riffs, then Tallent adding the bottom, and Weinberg switching to the skins. The song cycles back to the stripped-down approach for the last verse, as the E Street Band vocally sustains a quiet, one-note chorus in the background. The most tremendous moment of “Racing in the Street” belongs to Bittan, when he steps in to perform a brilliant, deeply expressive solo for the song’s last minute. Federici comes in with organ, Weinberg offers a simple rhythm alongside Tallent, and there’s some soft coloring from guitar, but the major emotional note is carried by Bittan’s piano, bringing the song to its fitting, majestic conclusion.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-310-0-0@published data-word-count=224><strong>7. <a href=#>“Jungleland,” Born to Run</a>.</strong> This is the culmination of Springsteen’s street epics. He pulls together all of the characters, elements, and scenes he’d previously written to create his masterpiece of the genre. It’s one of his definitive songs, but it’s also one of the most inscrutable, which explains why it didn’t get played on the radio much. “Jungleland” is not a single; it’s that song that outsiders know about, but don’t know. In other words, it’s Springsteen’s covenant with the early fans. It’s for and about them —&nbsp;“the hungry and the hunted” —&nbsp;and it’s written in code, the way troubadours would transmit news to peasants without the nobility catching wind of a message. Magic Rat and Barefoot Girl escape the Maximum Lawmen. The “opera out on the Turnpike” is the old Garden State Arts Center. Kids flash guitars just like switchblades. The performance is phenomenally operatic, with so much color, shading, emotion, and tension. Bittan is the MVP —&nbsp;on piano, organ, and Fender Rhodes —&nbsp;and when the guitar does come in, Bruce is at his fiercest, accompanied by the drums so regal and precise. And, of course, there’s that heartrending sax solo. In many ways, “Jungleland” is Clarence’s song. His solo emotionally dominates the track, so much so that <a href=#>Springsteen waited a year after the Big Man’s passing to play it live again</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-311-0-0@published data-word-count=109><strong>6. <a href=#>“Backstreets,” Born to Run</a>.</strong> “Backstreets” is full of urgency, longing, and disappointment. It’s a song about the point of no return, when you realize your youthful innocence is gone for good. It’s about betrayal, a feeling contained in the languid electric twang guitar that’s underneath the other melody lines. It gives the song its heat, alongside the intensity generated by the organ and the piano. And then there’s the breathless, heated quality of Springsteen’s vocals, deliberately obscured by the instruments in the verses, then pumped way up to the top of the mix on the choruses. The guitar solo, so tight and compact, is one of Springsteen’s finest.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-312-0-0@published data-word-count=165><strong>5. <a href=#>“The Promised Land,” Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>.</strong> “The Promised Land” seems simple on the surface. Its artfulness lies in the way it slowly builds tension from verse to verse, supported by the consistent forward movement of the chorus. The words of the chorus don’t change, but its meaning is morphed by each preceding verse. Right before that last one, there’s a combination of three solos —&nbsp;guitar, saxophone, and harmonica — that clear the way for the power of that final verse, set further apart by the E Street Band’s quiet, unified vocal harmony. “Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted,” Springsteen commands, before the harmonica solo kicks in, a clarion call meant to marshal him for whatever’s on the other side of the storm. It calls to mind an insight Springsteen offered to <a href=#>Rolling Stone in 1978</a>: “All my songs are about people at that moment when they’ve got to do something, just do something, do anything.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-313-0-0@published data-word-count=71><b>4. <a href=#>“Badlands,” <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i></a>.</b> One of Springsteen’s definitive anthems, “Badlands” is a call to attention, a rallying cry, the drumbeat measured behind an impassioned vocal. “I was searching for a tone somewhere between <i>Born to Run</i>’s spiritual hopefulness and ‘70s cynicism,” Springsteen wrote in <i>Songs</i>. It’s got love, hope, faith, deep-seated belief, and one of his best lines: “It ain’t no sin to be glad you’re alive.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-314-0-0@published data-word-count=217><b>3. <a href=#>“Born in the U.S.A.,” <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i></a></b> For anyone who bothers to listen, “Born in the U.S.A.” is quite simply one of Springsteen’s most compact and unambiguous songs. Don’t trust those who dismiss the track as simplistic or jingoistic. It gets written off as a victim of ‘80s production values, which is also shortsighted criticism; the 2014 remastered version did a lot to remedy the worst compression-based hisses. Still, it’s pointless to fixate on overprocessed synthesizer. Roy Bittan is still playing that synth, and the song is still built on Max Weinberg’s snare drum, a simple downbeat that borrows as much from “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” as it does “Street Fighting Man.” On top of all of that, Tallent’s bass rumbles with the same ferocity as his partner in the rhythm section, but with such insane power. (If you ever stand close enough to the stage during a live Springsteen show, especially in a stadium, the boosted bass will drive straight through you, especially on that last chorus.) It’s a downright transformative experience to watch Springsteen perform the song anywhere in Europe, where fans aren’t singing it out of blind patriotism, but rather because it was an international hit, it’s a good song, and it’s a chance to shout and fist-pump and sing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-315-0-0@published data-word-count=141><b>2. <a href=#>“Thunder Road,” <i>Born to Run</i></a>.</b> <i>Born to Run</i> was conceived as a song cycle of one day, beginning in the morning and ending in the nighttime. The piano chords that open “Thunder Road” are the sound of dawn, of new beginnings. The harmonica becomes the ignition key. Springsteen got absolutely everything right on this album: the production, the performance, the lyrics, the power, the space —&nbsp;all of which are exemplified on this opening track. The piano on “Thunder Road” is deceptively simple, bright and driving. The guitar line almost hides between the piano notes, peeking through at the right moments. Springsteen’s voice has never again delivered the same the mix of pathos and optimism and youthful lust for life. The sax solo remains one of Clemons’s greatest moments, a strong and encouraging answer to whether or not Mary climbed in.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-316-0-0@published data-word-count=206><b>1. <a href=#>“Born to Run,” <i>Born to Run</i></a>.</b> The song that earns every great cliché about rock and roll. It is escape, it is freedom, it is four-chord liberation. If you don’t like “Born to Run,” you don’t like Bruce Springsteen. The song distills every single element of Springsteen’s sound into four-and-a-half minutes, which contains the essential question his entire catalogue tries to answer: “I want to know if love is real.”* The performance is stellar. Tallent’s bass is more complex than you’d think, sometimes vibrating like a car engine, other times fluid and melodic, and he leads the charge for the last minute and 15 seconds. Federici swoops in and out with such power and grace, especially the way his organ comes in at “Just wrap your legs ‘round these velvet rims.” After his initial opening attack, Ernest “Boom” Carter is sitting back there on drums, swinging away. (It would be Boom’s sole appearance on a Springsteen track.) Bruce’s voice is warm and sad and sexy and full of soul, and Clemons’s solo is a reveille, a call to arms. “Born to Run” was Sancious’s swan song before leaving the E Street Band, and his piano melodies are ethereal and majestic. What a way to go.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-317-0-0@published data-word-count=1>_________</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e7446c7b84e701ca70807dbd4c590a03-318-0-0@published data-word-count=69><i>Thanks to Bruce Springsteen for his </i>Songs<i> anthology, </i>Backstreets<i> magazine for their fantastic unofficial liner notes for </i>Tracks<i>, the fine work done by&nbsp;<a href=#>springsteenlyrics.com</a>, and the people who maintain the definitive Springsteen live history over at&nbsp;<a href=#>Brucebase</a>.
