The two were friends before things turned romantic. She helped Keanu write his grown-up picture book Ode to Happiness. “No one can move the way he can. He’s a really extreme performer,” Grant said of Reeves at an L.A. gallery viewing, per the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>. “That’s a huge piece of why those images are so interesting. I knew that if I moved the camera as we danced together, as photographer and subject, we could create these wonderful optical illusions.”</p><p>They also collaborated on the book Shadows before they co-founded the publishing company X Artists’ Books in 2017. They walked the red carpet as friends in 2016 during the UNAIDS Galaat Design event. The two eventually made it official in 2019.
