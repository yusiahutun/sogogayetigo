Takeaways</h3><p>The Fiido ebike is an affordable and stowable entry worth your consideration.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Electric bikes are intriguing and incredibly cool contraptions. And just like electric cars, they're not super budget-friendly---except this one. The <a href=#>D3 Pro Mini from Fiido</a> gives people the ebike experience at a more affordable price while still delivering a healthy battery life and plenty of power.</p><p>Sure, $699.99 isn't a small sum of money, but most ebikes are priced at well over $1,000, sometimes closer to $2,000. Plus, it folds! It's already a pretty small bike when it's unfolded, but the fact that it can get even smaller makes it perfect for anyone who doesn't have a ton of extra space.</p><p>My riding experience with Fiido's D3 Pro Mini has been an absolute joy. An ebike gives you that nostalgic feel of riding your bike as a kid, but also the exhilarating thrill of fast speeds. But aside from feeling the wind in my hair and internally screaming, "Whee!" there's a lot to love about this ebike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=specs>Specs</h2><ul><li><strong>Voltage:</strong> 36V</li><li><strong>Battery:</strong> 7.8Ah / 280.8Wh</li><li><strong>Battery Cycle Times:</strong> 800 times</li><li><strong>Charging Time:</strong> 5 hours</li><li><strong>Moped Mode Range:</strong> 37.2 miles (60 km)</li><li><strong>Max Speed:</strong> 16MPH (25 km/h)</li><li><strong>Max Load:</strong> 265 lbs (120 kg)</li><li><strong>Net Weight:</strong> 38.6 lbs (17.5 kg)</li><li><strong>Tire Size:</strong> 14-inch x 2.125-inch</li><li><strong>Ebike Size (LxWxH):</strong> 1250mm x 580mm x 1000mm</li><li><strong>Folding Size (LxWxH):</strong> 1250mm x 400mm x 630mm</li></ul><h2 id=initial-setup-process>Initial Setup Process</h2><p>I thought setting up the D3 Pro Mini was going to be a task and a half, but it was super simple. The bike came in a box with the handlebar folded down, so to completely set it up, all I had to do was unfold the handlebars and attach the seat, pedals, and the brake light---which I think might have been a freebie sent with the bike. The brake light had a $29.99 price tag sticker on the box, but I can't find this particular light on Fiido's website.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After everything was attached, I chose a spot to plug the charger into the wall and hooked up the bike to fully charge it before taking it out. The <a href=#>bike seat post</a> I received had a built-in air pump---which I found as an add-on item on the website for $69.99---so I also aired up the tires a bit while it was charging. Then, I positioned all the adjustable pieces to my liking, and it was ready to go.</p><h2 id=design-amp-adjustability>Design & Adjustability</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/8b409c20.jpg> Sarah Chaney / Review Geek<p>The D3 Pro Mini ebike has a pretty snazzy design. There are plenty of attractive ebikes on the market, but there are also some ebikes that don't try to hide the battery, resulting in a design that's not very picturesque. Luckily, the D3 Pro Mini hides its battery within the frame and delivers a clean, striking design, whether you get the white or black frame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Its form factor resembles a BMX bike, which is typically lower to the ground and has a smaller frame and tires. If you need something that's compact and won't take up a ton of space in your home or garage, it's perfect for that. When you fold down the handlebar and fold in the brake pedals, it gets even more compact.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1d7f9e30.jpg> Sarah Chaney / Review Geek<p>Fiido boasts that this is one of the lightest ebikes on the market, and while that's true, I wouldn't say that the bike is lightweight. At just under 40 pounds, the D3 Pro Mini is easy to lift over a home's threshold or carry for short distances. But if you have to haul this bike up three flights of stairs to your apartment, I don't think it'd be an easy breezy experience. That said, it is lighter than other ebikes, including <a href=#>Velotric's Discover 1 ebike we reviewed</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Velotric Discover 1 E-Bike Review: An Affordable, Comfortable Cruiser</a></span></p><p>The bike is highly adjustable. You can modify the handlebar height, angle of the handlebar, and seat height. Also, I'm not sure why you would want to, but you can offset the handlebar to the right or left. As far as I could tell, there were no settings to adjust anything with the built-in headlight or the horn.</p><h2 id=battery-life-amp-charging>Battery Life & Charging</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cd83d67c.jpg> Sarah Chaney / Review Geek<p>For casual use and even casual commuter use---depending on how far from your job you live---you probably wouldn't need to charge this ebike more than once a week. The D3 Pro Mini has a max range of 37.2 miles and takes about five hours to fully charge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How fast the battery runs down depends on how much you're pedaling versus how much work the motor is doing. After roughly two hours worth of riding---half with pedal-assist and half using only the motor---the battery was at three out of five bars. Even if I take this bike out every single day for 15 to 30 minutes, I think I could get one to two weeks out of it before charging it.</p><h2 id=the-riding-experience>The Riding Experience</h2><p>People say you never forget how to ride a bike, and apparently, that's true. It's been at least seven years since I rode a regular bike, and I've never tried an ebike out before. Needless to say, I was nervous about getting on this thing for the first time. Luckily, I had the hang of it instantly. If you've ever ridden a regular bike before, riding the D3 Pro Mini will be a breeze.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Electric Bikes Practical?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After powering on the display, there are two different ways you can get going on the bike. You can start pedaling, and after you reach a certain speed, the motor automatically kicks on. Or, you can use the throttle on the right handlebar for an easier start. I'm a weary rider, so I always started off my rides by pedaling because I felt like I had more control. However, my husband always used the throttle---but he rides a motorcycle, so riding this ebike was a purely exciting experience for him.</p><p>I can't imagine why anyone would ever manually pedal this ebike, but I had to test it---you know, for science. It's hard. Because of the way that pedal-assist motors are designed, ebikes are often harder to pedal than traditional bikes with the power off. Plus, they're typically heavier. However, it's nice to know that the D3 Pro Mini can be pedaled just in case I'm out and the battery dies on me.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are three different gears to switch between by pushing a button on the display. You can see which gear you're in at any time by looking at the digital display. First gear delivers the least amount of power---and therefore speed---while third gear delivers the most. I felt comfortable riding at all speeds, though I preferred to work my way up to third gear instead of starting out there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/6fca85ef.jpg> Sarah Chaney / Review Geek<p>The D3 Pro Mini is a compact ebike with small wheels . There's a reason the word "Mini" is in its title. That said, I really wish the wheels were just a little bit bigger. There were times that it made me nervous to ride or take a turn at such a high speed because I was so low to the ground. You can raise the height of the seat and the handlebar, but obviously not the height of the brake pedals. As I became more comfortable riding the bike, this nervousness of being so close to the ground wore off a tad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I was impressed by the brakes on this bad boy. It has front and rear brakes, both connected to mechanisms on the left and right sides of the handlebar. I got up to max speed---about 15 miles per hour---and tried stopping as fast as possible. The bike does a great job braking at high speeds, though it does skid slightly.</p><p>Still, it's good to know that you can brake quickly in case of an emergency. Slowing down at a more reasonable pace feels smooth, and as long as you're paying attention to your surroundings, this braking experience will be the norm.</p><p>Making tight turns or U-turns is definitely something you should practice in a parking lot to get comfortable with. Because the motor automatically kicks on after you start pedaling, trying to U-turn from a static position feels unsafe because halfway through your turn, you jolt forward. You either have to use the remainder of your bike's speed as it slows down or walk the bike through the turn, which only makes sense if you're not on a busy street.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ac4c7bf1.jpg> Sarah Chaney / Review Geek<p>If your town is bike-friendly---with either bike lanes or people who are friendly to bikes riding in the car lane---then it's probably okay to use in the streets. Otherwise, I'd stick to residential areas and bike-specific areas. The area I'm currently in doesn't have a lot of bikers, so motorists aren't always the most courteous and there aren't many bike lanes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>RadRunner Electric Bike Review: Perfect for Your First E-Bike</a></span></p><p>There are a few other small tidbits worth noting from my riding experience. The horn works and will definitely catch someone's attention, but it's a super annoying sound. If you've ever heard the difference between a car horn and a motorcycle horn, it sounded closer to a motorcycle horn but more high-pitched and squeaky.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The bike has an IP54 water-resistant rating, which means you can ride it in light rain but shouldn't ride it in heavy rain. Then, I went over quite a few bumps and patches of rough road while riding through my neighborhood. Overall, the bike handled everything flawlessly.</p><h2 id=folding-amp-unfolding-the-bike>Folding & Unfolding the Bike</h2><p>I had never heard of a folding ebike before the D3 Pro Mini. I've seen regular bikes that fold before, but never an ebike. To be honest, I expected a bit more folding action than what the D3 Pro Mini gave me. After looking through Fiido's website, the <a href=#>D4S Folding Ebike</a> resembles more of what I expected.</p><p>With the D3 Pro Mini, the only part that truly folds is the handlebar. The brake pedals can also fold in to make the form factor thinner. However, I think that the D3 Pro Mini's form factor is already so small that it doesn't need to fold much to fit into small spaces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Folding and unfolding everything is a fast and easy process. The brake pedals have a mechanism in the middle that you have to push in, and then you can raise or lower the brake pedals. For the handlebar, there's a hinge that allows them to fold and unfold. When you bring the handlebar up, you have to lock them into place with a tightening latch that's on the pole. Then, before unfolding the handlebar, you have to release this latch.</p><h2 id=verdict-the-d3-pro-mini-is-a-compact-and-affordable-ebike>Verdict: The D3 Pro Mini Is a Compact and Affordable Ebike</h2><p>Fiido's D3 Pro Mini is a compact ebike that's fairly powerful. If you're specifically looking for a foldable ebike that can fit into tight spaces and is relatively affordable, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one. That said, Fiido has <a href=#>other folding ebikes</a> for about the same price that are able to fold into an even more compact shape, but I haven't personally tested any of those. But they don't cost much more, and the specs are better, on paper at least they might be the better buy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you have the space, I think a larger ebike from Fiido is worth the extra money. A larger frame and bigger wheels translates to a more comfortable ride---at least, for me---and it's also able to accommodate a bigger battery and/or motor for more power and longevity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/65ee8d24.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Fiido D3 Pro Mini Electric Bike</h5><p class=display-card-description></p><strong class=sub-title>Pros</strong><ul class=pro-list><li class=icon>Super compact form factor</li><li class=icon>Feels great, even at higher speeds</li><li class=icon>Decent battery life</li></ul><strong class=sub-title>Cons</strong><ul class=con-list><li class=icon>Wish it folded more</li><li class=icon>Pricey, but much more affordable than other e-bikes</li></ul><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Fiido</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhobGtgZ4Vwssiim6hllGh6sb7OZqSipplism6uyKScZqqVq7amw4ybnKChnqOys3nFq6CeppShxm6tzZ1kn6ecma6juMRo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jiya-shankar-urges-fans-to-pray-for-her-mom-as-shes-hospitalized-says-weve-been-put-in-a-tough-situation-1293473.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jiya Shankar urges fans to pray for her mom as she's hospitalized; says 'Weve been put in a tough</a>
