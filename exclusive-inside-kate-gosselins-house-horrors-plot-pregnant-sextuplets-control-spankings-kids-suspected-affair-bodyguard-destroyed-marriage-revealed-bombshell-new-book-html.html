And they weren't, says Hoffman, even wining and dining in Beverly Hills</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She pushed one of the children outside in sub-freezing temperatures without a coat or hat because the boy failed to close the door properly when he came in. 'The child was screaming and crying and banging on the doors all around the house.' He was hysterical and bright red from the bitter cold.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Sources of mine who are very close to the family, and who have been inside the house with Kate, have told me that Kate is a big drinker,' writes Hoffman.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I have been told things like:âWine is her drink of choice to take the edge off.â<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>âShe drinks the cheap stuff. She regularly drinks an entire bottle of wine herself at night before going to bed. She also drinks wine during the day.â<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>âKate has staffers buy the wine for her and bring it to the house in bags so nobody would know about it.â'<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'The Gosselin children were nothing more than collateral damage in a business driven by greed'. Kate had no emotional connection with any of her children.</span><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Jon Gosselin or a volunteer bathed and fed them, played with them while Kate created lists and barked out orders and focused on her tan, her jogging routine, her nails, traveling to New York City to get her hair done, shopping and tweeting.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The intrusion of television cameras in their lives greatly impacted the children as well as Jon. Kate had changed from the woman he had married.<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Thanksgiving 2008 was the first time the Neildâs came to the Gosselin house for a holiday. Jon thought it was very awkward because by this time, Kate had already decided that their marriage was over and Jon suspected it was because of her having an affair with Steve'.</span><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'The fact that Kate was away with Steve more than she was home and Jon was left at home with all eight kids really started to anger him and get him thinking about them being together.<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'He started asking her more and more questions about it which made her more and more angry with Jon. Whether or not theyâre having an affair, the topic of Kate and Steve together was what really drove Jon and Kate apart'.</span><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Jon finally refused to participate in Kate's greedy money making schemes, taking money from sympathetic people at her speaking engagements at church, lying to everyone about being poor.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'The moment he wanted the filming to stop, Kate no longer had a need for him. She came to view him as an enemy who threatened to destroy the rich dream world she had so carefully built'.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She refused to go into couple's therapy or marriage counseling.&nbsp; In Jon's mind, the only explanation for this is that she already had another man in her life and the only person it could have been was Steve Neild'.</span><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Neild originally hired by Discovery, had been brought in to protect the children while Kate and Jon travelled for filming. But he became Kate's&nbsp; bodyguard, travel companion, manager and pack mule - and rumored to be her lover.</span><span>He was rarely away from her side.</span></p><img id=i-97309213fde7732b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/24/article-2667590-1F15694600000578-111_634x958.jpg height=958 width=634 alt="Master manipulator: Former reporter Robert Hoffman believes that cake was out for fame and fortune, and didn't care who she hut in the process, in his new book" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Master manipulator: Former reporter Robert Hoffman believes that cake was out for fame and fortune, and didn't care who she hut in the process, in his new book</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Kate began traveling with Steve and leaving Jon at home to take care of the kids.</span><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>On family vacations, 'Kate took lots of pictures of Steve whether alone or playing with the kidsâ. </span><span><br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She refused any reconciliation with her husband and father of their eight children,<br></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Steve was always included in the family's personal holidays.

She promptly fired the nanny beloved by the children because the nanny got along with Jon.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>At Halloween, she'd drive the kids three plus hours down to Maryland to trick or treat in Steve's neighborhood.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'In the summer of 2009, Kate started removing large amounts of money from the Gosselin's joint bank accounts. Instead of depositing it in an account under her own name, she put it in a trust fund and chose Steve Neild as the trustee. '</span><span>The bodyguard,' writes Hoffman. 'The family friend who silently stands by Kate while hiding her lies and her secrets. The friends who turns a blind eye while she abuses her children'.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>When Kate sat down to do an interview with Meredith Vieira on the</span><span> Today show on October 5, 2009, she launched into her financial ruin sob story crying crocodile tears and saying she had a stack of bills in her purse that she couldn't afford to pay.</span><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'She actually had at least ten bank accounts each containing $200,000 or more. In addition she had many investment accounts and her 2008 tax return showed an adjusted gross income of $1,954,414.00,â says the author.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'In reviewing the events that created and fueled the Gosselin Family phenomenon, and ultimately turned it into a tragedy of epic proportions, one thing is very clear. The desire for money and power, caused eight innocent children to be exploited and abused in the most despicable ways,' concludes Hoffman.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><br></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><b><span>Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled the World by Robert Hoffman is available on </span><a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span>Amazon</span></a></b><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Fd4KWbnBpZ3WNkI2hsoKNfmV5o8CqsMRmgpqslWKUsL%2FSnqOipqNilbDB0p5kgaeip7yzv4ypo6isXaW%2FprPNmqWtZaOaxbXBz6WcratdmLyvwNGoo2aroJa7rLXNoKpmo5mZwG6%2F1KynnpukmrFurcWfmKKqXZe8pcXGrpirnF2ZsrTA0aiwnpxdoq6zvsianp5loprDpq3Lnptmmp%2Bir7S0xKWjZqaVrHqju86kZaGsnaE%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-rising-trend-gappy-teeth-dentist-reveals-influx-women-want-london-look-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;The rising trend of GAPPY teeth: Dentist reveals influx of women want 'the London look'</a>
