They reasoned the threat of a gun would be enough to persuade most men to unlock a vault. It just meant that all the money in town was in one place and if there was enough of it to make it worth investing in a such security there was enough to make it worth robbing.</span></p><p><span>According to a detailed account of James' life by the historian Mark Lee Gardner, the day they rode into Northfield, September 7, 1876, they were ‘at the top of their game.</span></p><p><span>But the bank staff resisted. Frustrated, Frank James fired shots above bookkeeper Joseph Heywood’s head.</span></p><p><span>In the smoke and confusion a colleague though he had been shot and made a run for it,bringing more shots from the robber. Everything began to unravel.<br></span></p><p><span>The town was alerted to the raid taking place. All their money was held in that building – all uninsured. They decided to fight.<br></span></p><p><span>The gun battle lasted less than ten minutes – panicked the gang members who had been keeping watched dashed to and fro amid bullets and rocks that arced through the air as locals fought with anything to hand. Inside all was confusion and violence.</span></p><p><span>Mr Gardner states, ‘While the townspeople were shooting to kill, the outlaws’ shots were really meant to frighten, to scare away, to buy time – at least in the beginning.’</span></p><p><span>Keeping watch outside, panic growing Cole Younger signalled the retreat: ‘For God’s sake,’ he shouted. ‘Come out. They are shooting us all to pieces.’</span></p><p><span>When it was over robbers Clell Miller and Bill Chadwell lay dead in the street. Bookkeeper Joseph Heywood had a bullet in his head and another local had been killed in the frenzy outside.&nbsp; The gang’s haul totalled just $26.60 ‘in coin and crip.’</span></p><p><span>Bob Coles had been hit. They left, six men on five horses and for the next 14 days evaded capture in what became the largest manhunt in US history.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/14/article-2507310-1968CCE900000578-342_625x644.jpg height=644 width=625 alt="With a large bounty on his head, Jesse James was eventually shot and killed by Robert Ford, a member of his own gang" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>With a large bounty on his head, Jesse James was eventually shot and killed by Robert Ford, a member of his own gang</p><p><span>More than 1000 men chased them across marsh and woodland. Cole Younger later recalled: ‘We suffered in those fourteen days a hundred deaths.’</span></p><p><span>Jesse managed to slip away and live in St Jo under a false name, unaware there was a $10,000 bounty on his head.<br></span></p><p><span>But one morning, as the 34-year-old Jesse climbed on a chair to straighten a picture, he was shot in the back of the head by gang member Robert Ford.</span></p><p><span>Ford cut James down as he stood to adjust a picture in the parlour of his home. James was parnoid after a life on the run and had invited Ford and his brother Charles to live with him and his wife Zee and protect them.</span></p><p><span>'Meet me in Kansas City tonight or tomorrow. I have my man,' Jesse James assassin Robert Ford's telegram to Governor Crittenden.</span></p><p><span>Instead the man who had survived shooting battles and daring raids, died as he had lived; by the bullet and for bounty.</span></p><p><span>While his wife wept by her dying husband’s side Bob and Charley Ford, Mr Gardner writes: ‘Quickly grabbed their hats and also Jesse’s revolvers and gun belt and hurried off for the town’s only telegraph office.</span></p><p><span>‘Once there, Charley paced nervously…as Bob tried several times to write out a telegram.’</span></p><p><span>When he finally handed a piece of paper to the operator it read as follows: ‘Meet me in Kansas City tonight or tomorrow. I have my man.'</span></p><p><span>The telegram was addressed to Thomas Crittenden, Governor of Missouri who had placed a $10,000 reward on Jesse, dead - $40,000 if he was taken alive but no-one really believed Jesse James would be taken alive.</span></p><p><span>‘If you hear they’ve captured me alive,’ he once said to a cousin. ‘Say it’s a lie; they may kill me, but they will never get me otherwise.’</span></p><p><span>That they captured him at all was an event that, according to Mr Gardner, had its beginnings in the chaos of Northfield, Minnesota and the raid on the town’s First National Bank.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2FdnyWbGhpZ3qawLSxjIOYpp2jYpCwuNNma25loprDsLjVnqlmnailsqTAxJ1kn52kmLVufcxmmK6bpJ68r3mQbGdmsZWWv7R5zq6rpZmnqHqiv9KaqqyhnpbBqrvNZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./summer-rusty-page-fighting-foster-daughter-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Summer and Rusty Page are fighting to keep their foster daughter</a>
