Luckily, her roommate knew that he had an album coming out, and warned her, he might just be promoting it.</span></p><p><span>“Was this just a promo?” Diana asked. To which, Dominic retorted, “No, I loved you in Space Force.”</span></p><p><span>Out of the blue, Diana then asked him to come with her on a walk the next day, and the rest is history.</span></p><p><span>On their first date, they went talked about Paul McCartney.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Diana Silvers?</b></h3><p><span>Diana Silvers is an actress based in New York / Los Angeles best known for her role as “Erin Naird” in the TV series </span><i><span>Space Force</span></i><span> (2020).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Also, she has portrayed “Kimberly Tooms” in the series </span><i><span>Into the Dark</span></i><span> (2018), “Hope” in </span><i><span>Booksmart</span></i><span> (2019), “Maggie” in</span><i><span> Ma</span></i><span> (2019), Camille in </span><i><span>Ava (2020),</span></i><span> and “Kate Sanders” in </span><i><span>Birds of Paradise </span></i><span>(2021).</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, this aspiring actress has also graced TV shows like </span><i><span>Camp Confessions</span></i><span> (2019), </span><i><span>Filme Gitmeden Önce</span></i><span> (2020), </span><i><span>IMDb on the Scene – Interviews</span></i><span> (2020), and </span><i><span>Steve Varley Show</span></i><span> (2021).</span></p><p><span>Besides being an actor, Diana is also a professional model who has worked with the Wilhelmina and IMG modeling agencies.

So, our guess? They’ve probably split. Also, it’s been quite a while since we last heard them talk about each other.</span></p><p><span>Here’s Dominic’s IG @</span><a href=#><span>dominicfike</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Recalling their moments, Dominic and Diana did look like they were meant for each other. And it sure would cause many heartbreaks if the two have broken up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The </span><i><span>Euphoria</span></i><span> star often talked about how Diana influenced his music. “She likes old music, movies, and clothing. It’s influenced my music for the better,” he once shared.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, he also once revealed that they were so close they shared a closet. In fact, over that interview, he even was wearing one of Diana’s zebra socks.</span></p><p><span>The last we saw them together was in mid-2021, quarantined at their apartment. At the time, they mentioned that the first thing they were going to do when the world opened up was, visit </span><i><span>1 Oak</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Not sure, if they ever did.</span></p><h3><b>Dominic Fike Relationship Status</b></h3><p><span>Dominic Fike appeared to be single as of Jan 2022.

However, he did share that Elliot was a “homie” who hangs out with Rue and Jules.</span></p><p><span>Also, he shed light on the dynamic behind the scenes, mentioning co-stars Zendaya (Rue) and Hunter Schaefer (Jules) as the “nicest people ever.”</span></p><h3><b>Is Dominic Fike Gay?</b></h3><p><span>No, Dominic Fike isn’t gay. He has dated over 2 ladies in the past.</span></p><p><span>The rumors about him being “gay’, was just a downside that came along with popularity. As of 2022, there were no reports about the star ever having a relationship with a man.</span></p><p><span>If you’re here after seeing Dominic sharing a steamy kiss with Lil Nas X, it was just for their song “Count On Me” music video.</span></p><p><span>And for those of you who missed it, the music video begins with the pair as lovers on holiday, which quickly turns into an animation, after they kiss passionately.</span></p><h3><b>Dominic Fike Dating History</b></h3><p><span>Before dating Diana Silvers, Dominic Fike was in a relationship with a </span><i><span>Columbia Records</span></i><span> stylist, named Shelby Tangorra.
