Some of them were violent and really nasty with me.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'One of them would lock me in the bathroom when he wanted to go out to bingo with my mum.

Mum would always make sure there was food on the table but I never had clean clothes.

He finally went to the police when he was in his thirties (file photo)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He said: 'I didn't tell anyone what was happening to me. I thought about speaking to a teacher but I was really scared - my father had a really bad temper and was a threatening man.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I tried to ignore what my father was doing and get on with my life. I was always a quiet child, and even now I don't speak a lot. I internalised my feelings and worries about my life and the abuse and locked my thoughts in a box in my head.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Gareth said the sexual abuse finally stopped when he was 13 but it continued to impact on his life.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It affected relationships I had as I grew older. Sex used to really worry me and I would delay it within the relationship for as long as possible. The thought of having sex really frightened me, and I didn't feel like I could tell my girlfriends at the time why,' he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I used to get wound up, angry and moody about things. I think because I kept everything inside about what had happened to me and didn't cry or talk about it sometimes my feelings would just burst out of me and I couldn’t control them.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It was only after becoming a father himself that Gareth realised how terrible his parent's crimes were and that he couldn't let him get away with them.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He said: 'About four years ago I decided to go to the police and the case went to court. My father initially pleaded not guilty to the offences. I didn't want the case to go to trial; I just wanted him to admit what he'd done.'</span></p>&nbsp;I tried to ignore what my father was doing and get on with my life. I was always a quiet child, and even now I don't speak a lot<p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Gareth wasn't his father's only victim and as the police investigated, he was charged with abusing another two boys.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He eventually admitted what he had done and pleaded guilty. Jailing him for 13 years in 2013, a judge called him wicked and evil.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Now in his early sixties, he must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Speaking of the prosecution, Gareth said: 'When my father was convicted and sentenced I felt free for the first time in my life. I didn't feel like I was looking over my shoulder anymore.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'As a father to young children myself, I was always fearful that he would find a way to get to them too. I know I can take my children to the local park and that he won't be there, he's going to be locked away.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Now Gareth wants to help other children in need so he's signed up to run next year's Virgin Money London Marathon for the NSPCC.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He said: 'When I had my children, I realised how much my father had ruined my childhood. I don't want them to have to suffer anything like I did. I just want to give them everything that we didn't have as kids.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I decided to run for the NSPCC because I want to protect other children from going through the awful abuse I did as a child.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I want to promote the NSPCC's amazing work protecting children and preventing abuse.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Gareth agreed to share his story to promote the work of the NSPCC and he hopes other people will sign up to run the London Marathon for them and raise lots of money in the process.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>He said the training has been beneficial for both his physical and mental health. &nbsp;</span></p><img id=i-6b5a51a86c94de59 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/24/13/2ACE506D00000578-3173341-The_NSPCC_are_looking_for_more_volunteers_to_run_and_raise_money-a-43_1437742219156.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="The NSPCC are looking for more volunteers to run and raise money for them in next year's marathon" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The NSPCC are looking for more volunteers to run and raise money for them in next year's marathon</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I've found the training really therapeutic, I actually really enjoy running now and have lost over three and a half stone.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It feels like therapy for me, I can go out and work thoughts and feelings through my head and I come back feeling better, like I've let go of what happened to me a little.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I'd like to say to anyone out there who is thinking of running for the NSPCC to just do it.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'They help so many children facing such awful abuse.
