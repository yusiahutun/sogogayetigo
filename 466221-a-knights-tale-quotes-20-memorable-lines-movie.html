I first met him atop a mountain near Jerusalem, praying to God, asking his forgiveness for the Saracen blood spilt by his sword. Next, he amazed me still further in Italy when he saved a fatherless beauty from the would-be ravishing of her dreadful Turkish uncle. – Paul Bettany</li><li>I know, child. Pray that the years come quickly for you, taking your beauty so that you may better serve Him. – Roger Ashton-Griffiths</li><li>Jocelyn: I do, every day. A wha- a what? A writer. You know, I write with ink and parchment. For a penny, I'll scribble anything you want from summonses, decrees, edicts, warrants, patents of nobility. I've even been known to jot down a poem or two if the muse descends. Probably read my book, book of the Duchess? Fine, well, it was allegorical. – Paul Bettany</li><li>What a pair we make, huh? Both trying to hide who we are, both unable to do so. Your men love you. If I knew nothing else about you, that would be enough. But you also tilt when you should withdraw... and that is knightly, too. – James Purefoy</li><li>It’s like anything in life, visualizing the old man you’re going to become: As long as you have a clear picture of the life you want to lead, you'll eventually get there.</li><li>If I could ask God one thing, it would be to stop the moon.
