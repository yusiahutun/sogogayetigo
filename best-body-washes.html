More than ever, the humble body care product has leaped out of the grocery store aisle and found itself a new home amongst other luxury beauty mainstays. From brands that are using facial-grade skincare ingredients to derm-developed lines designed for sensitive-skin, high-end perfume companies expanding into shower gel, and even your tried-and-true drugstore favorites using powerful actives to create high-quality formulas, there’s something new and exciting out there for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And no matter if your skin is dry, oily, sensitive, eczema-prone, or suffering from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>keratosis pilaris</a>, we’ve found the right wash for you — from ultra-nourishing creamy cleansers to gel-based products that curb acne and oil production.

The substantial consistency means that a little bit of product goes quite a long way, making the bottle last far longer than you might think (an average of three to four months). Just don’t expect a sudsy experience — the gel texture gets us clean without the traditional lather.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Vitamin C, vitamin E, niacinamide | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Cleanses, nourishes, smooths, softens | <strong>Size:</strong> 8.4 oz | <strong>Scents:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-native-body-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Native Body Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Native Coconut and Vanilla Body Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fUdg9NPCKT2oIyW-z5vc5eWkDAw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Native-Coconut-and-Vanilla-Body-Wash-9d92880444c54709b3cf22649f5dcb6d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This budget-friendly pick creates a luxurious, sudsy lather using simple ingredients — and it’s offered in 20 refreshing aromas.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The scents don’t linger for long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re such big fans of Native Body Wash, we could’ve slotted it in a number of superlative spots. We ultimately decided that the product’s thick texture and indulgent foamy lather is seriously impressive considering the affordable price point. It doesn’t leave that filmy residue that sometimes occurs with other less expensive cleansers. Instead, it deeply hydrates from the very first application. “My skin is always silky after using this,” says Honkus.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And, we’re seriously obsessed with their wide range of delectable scents — 20 different options to be exact. “Along with traditional soothing fragrances, they also offer more obscure choices like Aloe & Green Tea, as well as nostalgia-inducing Sour Berry Belts,” adds Honkus. “And, aside from cleansing the body, this also makes for the most luscious, frothy bubble bath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Citric acid, sodium cocoyl isethionate | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Cleanses, refreshes, nourishes | <strong>Size:</strong> 18 oz | <strong>Scents:</strong> 20</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-byredo-body-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Byredo Body Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Byredo Body Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/euWGYRG-oLAckLvjL778WUm5xYA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byredo-body-wash-924c434de5914fc5a9754542cd55700a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Byredo’s scents are luxe and dreamy — we save this body wash for those extra special self-care showers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t come with a pump, which makes usage less than convenient.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Byredo began as a luxury perfume brand, so when they expanded into bath and body care, it came as no surprise that they led with their beloved scents (including La Tulipe, Mojave Ghost, and Gypsy Water).

Whenever we use it, we get hints of the scent throughout the day, even if we haven’t followed up with the matching lotion or perfume.&nbsp; As for the formula, the gel-like consistency feels thick and hydrating for a nourishing shower experience. Rather than using it as our everyday cleanser, we like to save it for indulgent self-care occasions.

And this Deep Moisture Body Wash pick is no different. Recommended by NYC-based board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Marisa Garshick</a> for its deeply hydrating ingredients, it’ll clear up dry patches and leave skin looking instantly renewed. “This body wash is a great option for all skin types, but especially for those with dry skin, as it not only provides a gentle cleanse, leaving the skin feeling clean, it’s now formulated with moisturizing Micro Moisture Droplets to nourish the skin,” she says. Proven to hydrate the skin’s natural moisture barrier for a full 24 hours, you’ll be feeling silky smooth from day to night.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, we love that the ergonomic bottle can be stored in the shower upside down for easy access, and its 100% recyclable. Meanwhile, the formula is free from all harmful chemicals (parabens, sulfate, and more), is vegan, and PETA-approved.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Glycerin, Citric Acid | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Deeply hydrates, nourishes dry skin | <strong>Size:</strong> 20 oz. | <strong>Scents:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-scent-aesop-geranium-leaf-body-cleanser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Scent</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aesop Geranium Leaf Body Cleanser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aesop Geranium Leaf Body Cleanser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5nAEQYfJ4di1FYf7MEYD9jga84w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Aesop-Geranium-Leaf-Body-Cleanser-4439d238040f448cb222b80eb5a64dd9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s our philosophy that anyone who stocks Aesop in their bathroom has exceedingly good taste — the brand is aesthetically chic and known for their elevated scents.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Look, this is a personal grievance — but, we wish Aesop would make their fan-favorite hand wash scent (Resurrection) in their signature shower gel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aaah, Aesop — the body care brand of choice for artsy bros and hip downtown restaurant bathrooms. But seriously, their body cleanser lives up to the hype with its luxuriously thick gel texture and naturally-derived scents that will draw in any intriguing passerby with impeccable taste. We’re partial to the Geranium scent for a flirty floral moment that's rooted in leafy greens and refreshing citrus, but A Rose By Any Other Name will surprise and delight with its warm and spicy rose notes, while Coriander Seed is ideal for those who prefer something more woody and peppery with a masculine appeal.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The shower gel formula is low-lather and non-drying, leaving skin feeling smooth and hydrated straight out of the shower. And while we’re disappointed that our true favorite Aesop scent — Resurrection, a citrusy and herbaceous blend — isn’t made in their body wash, we’ve found that the brand’s shower and hand wash formulas are surprisingly similar and nearly interchangeable. Personally, I’ve gone ahead and used them both as such. And though the price point is high, we’ve been impressed with how long the 16.9 oz. bottle lasts, rendering it definitely worth the splurge.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Glycerin, Citric Acid, Geranium Leaf, Mandarin Orange Rind | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Cleanses, refreshes | <strong>Size:</strong> 16.9 oz. | <strong>Scents:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acne-neutrogena-body-clear-acne-body-scrub-with-salicylic-acid></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Acne</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Neutrogena Body Clear Acne Body Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Neutrogena Body Clear Body Scrub" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/L3DA4mtVCdWr4A6gWL_ydZUmZo8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign2-c5fcde1a02f34f49a7927639ca1805b4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another derm-recommended pick, this Neutrogena Clear Body Wash specifically <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>targets acne and breakouts</a> throughout the body with deep pore-cleansing active ingredients like salicylic acid and vitamin C. According to Dallas-based board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Dr. Rebecca Marcus</a>, “the 2% salicylic acid breaks up oil, treats existing acne, and prevents new breakouts from forming.” And the small active dosage renders the wash gentle enough for everyday use, ready to remove the regular grime and impurities of daily life without being overly-drying. Meanwhile, the formula’s vitamin C works to repair discoloration and post-acne marks over time — restoring the skin to its natural smooth brilliance with consistent use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Personally, we are fans of the natural grapefruit extract scent, but it can be a bit too potent for some.

But, not this Dermalogica formula — it’s chock full of ultra-nourishing essential oils that hydrate and moisturize while gently cleansing.

This is one of those products where you’ll see best results with consistency over time — though eczema flare ups will most definitely lessen after a wash or two, you’ll see decreased noticeable dryness after three days, and more long-lasting clear skin after about two weeks (especially if you suffer from tight, cracked, or bumpy patches).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gentle enough to be used as part of a daily shower routine and also on children, the citric acid, aloe, and colloidal oatmeal combo will provide immediate relief and feel ultra-soothing, leaving your body sufficiently soft and moisturized.

Plus, the formula is fragrance-free, non-comedogenic, and recommended for safe use on both body and face (to get a sense of just how mild it is, most body washes use ingredients that are too harsh for the delicate facial skin). The soothing antioxidants cleanse the skin, while working to stabilize and rebalance the skin’s microbiome by providing 24-hour hydration.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After showering, you’ll be left with clean, supple, and soft skin — any rosacea patches, eczema flare-ups, or general irritation will be soothed.

Your skin will be left feeling soothed and softened, while the scent experience is refreshing and not overpowering. Plus, at $13.29 for a value-sized 32 oz. bottle, the price point is significantly lower than other beauty brands that boast clean and natural ingredients.

What makes CeraVe products so beloved is that no matter how targeted they are in stripping the skin of excess oils, they still incorporate necessary ceramides (1, 3, and 6-II) that work to replenish the skin barrier with hydration and nourishment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just keep in mind that anytime you’re using a formula with AHAs, your skin will be even more sensitive to the sun — meaning doubling down on SPF will be more important than ever.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Salicylic Acid, Alpha Hydroxy Acid | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Cleanses, controls the symptoms of Keratosis Pilaris and Psoriasis | <strong>Size:</strong> 8 oz. | <strong>Scents:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-skin-kosas-good-body-skin-aha--enzyme-exfoliating-body-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Oily Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kosas Good Body Skin AHA + Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kosas Good Body Skin AHA + Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MWteW2WF2J1JxoDcqSGp9i8mDHE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kosas-good-body-skin-aha---enzyme-exfoliating-body-wash-158e1575734943e3b14ff1f6a0f9dbbf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This shower gel incorporates exfoliating AHAs and enzymes for an all-in-one cleansing treatment that smooths and brightens.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>With oily and breakout-prone body skin, you may notice a detox period with this product where impurities come to the surface and purge before clearing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Oily skin is best offset by exfoliating ingredients that unclog pores, fight breakouts, and smooth texture — this deeply cleaning body wash from Kosas does it all and more. By mixing a blend of AHAs consisting of glycolic acid, lactic acid, and mandelic acid with natural tropical fruit enzymes, you’re getting a highly powerful cleanser that's specifically situated to target excessive oil production, grime buildup, and acne. Meanwhile, allantoin restores moisture to the skin barrier and soothes irritation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The clean beauty brand only uses facial-grade ingredients, even within their body care line. So, your skin will be visibly smoothed and brightened with a fresh, just-back-from-vacation glow. The wash is also ideal for when you desire a deeper clean after a workout or if you notice more oily patches during the summer months. We love the easy squeezable design of the bottle and the refreshing scent. Just don’t be surprised if acne-prone skin endures a purging period after starting with the wash — it’s just the impurities coming to the surface, but you’ll be pleased to find clear and smooth skin after a week or so.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Tropical Fruit Enzymes | <strong>Benefits:</strong> Cleanses, unclogs pores, reduces oil production, smoothes texture, brightens | <strong>Size:</strong> 9 oz. | <strong>Scents:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oil-cleanser-glossier-body-hero-daily-oil-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oil Cleanser</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Glossier Body Hero Daily Oil Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Glossier Body Hero Daily Oil Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/n0L9WJ4VTi--ZUVfMl3t8gpKP3o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/glossier-body-hero-daily-oil-wash-92004a51413e45c08b58f748446b618f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Like oil cleansers for your face, this soap-free body wash will remove grime without drying out the skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Because this is oil-based, don’t expect a full lather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like facial oil cleansers have gained popularity for their ability to cleanse the skin of makeup, sweat, and other impurities, oil-based body cleansers do the same. Glossier’s Body Hero Daily Oil Wash cleans the body by attracting unwanted oils like a magnet and lifting them from the skin without drying you out. A blend of coconut, olive, sesame seed, grapeseed, and soybean oils combine to rebalance the moisture barrier with essential nourishment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you can’t expect a robust lather experience with this cleanser, the texture will emulsify into a gentle milky consistency that exudes the soft orange blossom and neroli scent.

In their body wash line, there is an Energize Wash, a De-Stress Wash, and a Sleep Wash. In a dream world, we’d be ultra-indulgent and keep all three on hand to circle through, but for now, we’ll settle on the De-Stress Body Wash as our ultimate go-to for everyday. In addition to the ingredient list’s cleansing and moisturizing benefits, the essential oil blend is intended to promote clarity of thought, healing, and calm. It’s more than just a body wash that’ll leave you with super soft skin — you’re also receiving a reminder to breathe in the scents and enjoy the de-stress practice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And while we gave this product the best cream cleanser superlative, we will admit the consistency is a bit more of a cream-meets-gel than a traditional cream cleanser.

According to Dr. Garshick, those with sensitive skin should look for washes that are fragrance-free and paraben-free to minimize irritation. Our pick is the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Body & Face Wash</a>. For oily skin, Dr. Garshick says, “look for ingredients like salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid that also works to unclog pores and remove excess oil,” like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Neutrogena Clear Body Wash </a>or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kosas Good Body Skin AHA + Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash</a>.

Or for those with Keratosis Pilaris, she says, “key ingredients to consider are lactic acid, salicylic acid, or glycolic acid, which helps to get rid of dead skin cell buildup.

Also seek out products that are dermatologist-approved (many brands promote this on their packaging) or that are certified by the National Eczema Association.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ingredients for Oily Skin</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Marcus notes that oil production is best curbed by gel formulations and foaming washes.

And, of course, vitamin C is a favorite brightening ingredient that works to improve discoloration and increase radiance.

Essential oils, in particular, can be irritating to those with sensitive skin.” For a truly unscented option, we love the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SEEN Skin-Caring Fragrance Free Body Wash</a>, plus Native and Necessaire both make fragrance-free versions of their formulas as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, aromatherapy can play an important role in your body care routine.
